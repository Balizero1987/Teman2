Communication utilities for response formatting and analysis.

This package provides utilities for:
- Language detection and language-specific instructions
- Emotional content detection and empathetic response formatting
- Procedural question detection and step-by-step formatting
- Domain-specific formatting (Visa, Tax, Company)
- Explanation level detection (simple, standard, expert)

This module maintains backward compatibility with the original communication_utils module
by re-exporting all functions from the focused sub-modules.

Example usage:
    from backend.services.communication import detect_language, has_emotional_content

    language = detect_language(query)
    if has_emotional_content(query):
        instruction = get_emotional_response_instruction(language)
