"""
Agentic RAG with Tool Use - Refactored Architecture

This module has been refactored from a 2,200+ line monolithic file into
a well-structured package with clear separation of concerns:

Structure:
- tools.py: Tool class definitions (VectorSearch, WebSearch, Database, Calculator, Vision, Pricing)
- orchestrator.py: Main orchestrator with query processing and streaming (910 lines)
- llm_gateway.py: Unified LLM interface with model fallback cascade (493 lines)
- reasoning.py: ReAct reasoning loop (Thought→Action→Observation) (294 lines)
- prompt_builder.py: System prompt construction with caching
- response_processor.py: Response cleaning and formatting
- context_manager.py: User context and memory management
- tool_executor.py: Tool parsing and execution with rate limiting
- pipeline.py: Response processing pipeline with verification, cleaning, and citation stages

Key Features:
- Quality routing (Fast/Pro/DeepThink)
- ReAct pattern (Reason-Act-Observe)
- Multi-tier fallback (Gemini Pro -> Flash -> Flash-Lite -> OpenRouter)
- Native function calling with regex fallback
- Memory persistence and semantic caching
- Streaming and non-streaming modes
- Response verification and self-correction

Backward Compatibility:
All original exports are maintained for seamless integration with existing code.

    Factory function to create a fully configured AgenticRAGOrchestrator.

    This function assembles all required tools and initializes the orchestrator
    with proper configuration. It maintains backward compatibility with the
    original agentic.py interface.

    Args:
        retriever: Knowledge base retriever (SearchService/KnowledgeService)
        db_pool: PostgreSQL connection pool for database queries
        web_search_client: Optional web search client (disabled by default)
        semantic_cache: Optional semantic cache for query results
        clarification_service: Optional service for resolving ambiguous queries

    Returns:
        Configured AgenticRAGOrchestrator instance

    Tool Priority:
        1. VectorSearchTool (primary knowledge base search)
        2. TeamKnowledgeTool (team member queries)
        3. CRMClientsTool (client data management)
        4. GraphTraversalTool (knowledge graph exploration)
        5. DatabaseQueryTool (deep dive into full documents)
        6. CalculatorTool (numerical computations)
        7. VisionTool (visual document analysis)
        8. PricingTool (official Bali Zero pricing)
        9. DiagnosticsTool (system health checks)
        10. MCPSuperTool (admin operations)
        11. WebSearchTool (fallback, added last if available)
