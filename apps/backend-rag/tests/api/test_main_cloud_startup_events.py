"""
Test startup events initialize AlertService correctly.

Verifies that:
- Startup event initializes AlertService in app.state
- Startup can be called multiple times (idempotent)
- HealthMonitor uses app.state.alert_service

Note: These tests test the function logic directly.
When run together with other tests, conftest.py may interfere.
Run individually if needed: pytest tests/api/test_main_cloud_startup_events.py
