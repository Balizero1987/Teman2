# NPWP: Indonesian Tax Number for Foreigners 2026

NPWP (Nomor Pokok Wajib Pajak) is your Indonesian tax identification number. It's essential for tax compliance and many practical matters in Indonesia.

## Why You Need NPWP

### Required For:
- **Tax filing** - Can't file SPT without it
- **Lower tax rates** - 20% penalty without NPWP
- **Bank accounts** - Most banks require for accounts over certain thresholds
- **Property transactions** - Required for buying property
- **Certain visa processes** - Some visas request it

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="20% Tax Penalty">
Without NPWP, your income tax withholding is **20% higher**. On IDR 50M annual tax, that's IDR 10M extra. Get NPWP to avoid this.
</InfoCard>

| Section | Meaning |

| Digits 14-15 | Branch code (000 for main) |

## Online Registration (E-Registration)

You can also register online at **ereg.pajak.go.id**:

1. Create account
2. Fill online form
3. Upload documents
4. Submit
5. Visit KPP for verification (may be required)

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="Online vs In-Person">
Online registration is convenient but foreigners often still need to visit KPP for verification. Going directly to KPP can be faster for foreigners.
</InfoCard>

1. **Register for DJP Online** - For e-filing
2. **Get EFIN** - Electronic filing ID
3. **Update employer** - Give NPWP to HR
4. **Update bank** - Add to your accounts
