# Tax Treaties: Avoiding Double Taxation in Indonesia 2025

Indonesia has tax treaties (P3B) with 70+ countries to prevent the same income being taxed twice. Here's how to benefit.

## How Treaties Help

Tax treaties provide:

1. **Reduced withholding rates** - Lower tax on dividends, interest, royalties
2. **Tax credits** - Credit taxes paid in Indonesia against home country tax
3. **Tie-breaker rules** - When you're resident in two countries
4. **Exemptions** - Some income types may be exempt

## The Process

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Claiming Treaty Benefits">
1. **Get SKD** from your home country tax office
2. **Complete DGT Form** (Indonesian form)
3. **Give to payer** before they pay you
4. **Payer withholds** at treaty rate instead of 20%

If you don't provide documents, the payer must withhold at 20%. You may be able to claim a refund later, but it's complicated.

3. Claim credit for foreign tax paid
4. Pay only the difference (if any)

**Credit limited to**: Indonesian tax rate on that income
