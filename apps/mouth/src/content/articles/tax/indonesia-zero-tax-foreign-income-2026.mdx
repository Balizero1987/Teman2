# Indonesia's 0% Tax on Foreign Income: The Expat Advantage Most Don't Know

---

## THE 30-SECOND BRIEF

> **Is this real?** Yes. And it's legal.

- **What:** Indonesia taxes only Indonesian-sourced income (territorial system)
- **Who benefits:** Expats earning from foreign clients/employers
- **The rule:** PMK 18/2021 + UU HPP 2021
- **Result:** Foreign income = 0% Indonesian tax
- **Risk level:** LOW if structured correctly

---

## THE FACTS

Since 2021, Indonesia operates a **territorial tax system** under PMK 18/2021. This means:

| Income Source | Taxed in Indonesia? |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Work for Indonesian company | Yes |
| Clients in Indonesia | Yes |
| Foreign employer (no PE in Indonesia) | **No** |
| Foreign clients, work done remotely | **No** |
| Dividends from foreign stocks | **No** |
| Rental income from overseas property | **No** |

**The official regulation:** PMK No. 18/PMK.03/2021

**Key distinction:**
- **Indonesian-sourced income** = Taxed at normal rates (5-35%)
- **Foreign-sourced income** = Not brought into Indonesia = **0% tax**

<InfoCard type="success" title="How It Works">
  If you're a tax resident of Indonesia (183+ days/year) but earn income from:
  - A foreign company with no presence in Indonesia
  - Foreign clients who pay you offshore
  - Investments held outside Indonesia

  That income is **not subject to Indonesian income tax**, as long as it stays outside Indonesia for at least 3 years (for individuals) or is used for specific purposes if remitted earlier.
</InfoCard>

## WHO QUALIFIES?

**You can benefit if you:**

| Condition | Required? |
|-----------|-----------|
| Tax resident of Indonesia (183+ days) | Yes |
| Have NPWP (tax number) | Yes |
| Income is foreign-sourced | Yes |
| Income not yet remitted to Indonesia | Recommended |
| Income from employer with no Indonesian PE | Yes |

**You probably don't qualify if:**
- Your employer has an office in Indonesia
- You invoice Indonesian clients
- You're paid through an Indonesian bank account
- Your work is performed IN Indonesia FOR Indonesian entities

## THE BALI ZERO TAKE

**What most expats get wrong:**

The "0% tax on foreign income" isn't automatic. It requires:

1. **Proper structuring** of your employment/freelance relationship
2. **Keeping income offshore** (at least initially)
3. **Documentation** proving the income source is foreign
4. **Compliance** with NPWP and annual tax filings

**The reality check:**

Many digital nomads in Bali believe they're "tax free" because they earn in USD. Wrong. If you're here 183+ days, you're a tax resident. You MUST file an annual SPT.

The good news: Your foreign income may indeed be 0% taxed. But you need to:
- Have an NPWP
- File your SPT Tahunan every year
- Report your foreign income (even if not taxed)

<InfoCard type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">
  **Mistake 1:** Not filing at all ("I'm not taxed, why file?")
  - WRONG. Tax residents must file, even if liability is zero.

  **Mistake 2:** Mixing Indonesian and foreign income
  - If your foreign client also has Indonesian operations, it gets complicated.

  **Mistake 3:** Assuming VOA/B211A means no tax residency
  - Your visa type is irrelevant. 183 days = tax resident.
</InfoCard>

## PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

**Marco, Italian freelancer in Ubud:**
- Lives in Bali 300 days/year
- Has B211A visa
- Works for 3 European clients
- Paid to Wise account (EUR)
- No Indonesian clients

**Marco's tax situation:**
- Tax resident? **Yes** (300 days)
- NPWP required? **Yes**
- Must file SPT? **Yes**
- Indonesian tax on European income? **0%**

**What Marco must do:**
1. Get NPWP (one-time)
2. File SPT Tahunan by March 31 each year
3. Report foreign income as "non-taxable"
4. Keep bank statements as proof of foreign source

---

## HOW TO SET THIS UP RIGHT

### Step 1: Get Your NPWP
Even if your tax is zero, you need an NPWP. [Guide here](/tax/npwp-foreigners-guide)

### Step 2: Structure Your Income Correctly
- Ensure clients pay to a foreign bank account
- Have contracts that clearly state foreign entity
- Avoid any Indonesian PE (permanent establishment)

### Step 3: File Annually
- Deadline: March 31 for individuals
- Report all income (Indonesian + foreign)
- Apply territorial exemption for foreign income

### Step 4: Keep Documentation
- Foreign contracts
- Bank statements showing offshore payments
- Proof that income stayed outside Indonesia (if applicable)

## THE FINE PRINT

**3-Year Holding Period (for some cases):**

Under PMK 18/2021, if you want to remit foreign income to Indonesia tax-free, you may need to:
- Hold it offshore for 3 years, OR
- Invest it in qualifying Indonesian instruments

This applies mainly to investment income. Salary/freelance income has more flexibility.

**What if I bring money to Indonesia?**

If you remit within 3 years:
- May be taxed at normal rates
- Unless used for specific exempt purposes

**Our advice:** Consult a tax professional before moving large sums.
