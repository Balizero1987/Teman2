# Double Taxation Treaties Indonesia 2025: Complete Guide

Tax treaties help prevent the same income being taxed twice. Here's how Indonesia's DTAs work.

## What is a Double Taxation Agreement?

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Tax Treaty Basics">
A **Double Taxation Agreement (DTA)** or tax treaty is an agreement between two countries to:

- Prevent income being taxed in both countries
- Reduce withholding tax rates
- Define which country has taxing rights
- Provide relief mechanisms
- Enable tax information exchange

Indonesia has DTAs with 70+ countries.
