The most important question for any foreigner in Indonesia: **Are you a tax resident?** This determines whether Indonesia taxes only your Indonesian income, or your worldwide income.

<InfoCard variant="important" title="The 183-Day Rule">
The 183 days don't need to be consecutive. Indonesia counts days in any **12-month period**, which can span calendar years. Entry and exit days both count as full days.

Example: If you arrive October 1, 2024, and count forward 12 months to September 30, 2026—total days in Indonesia during this period determines residency.

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="How Progressive Tax Works">
You don't pay 35% on all your income if you earn over IDR 5 billion. Each bracket only applies to income within that range.

**Example:** If you earn IDR 300 million annually:
- First IDR 60M taxed at 5% = IDR 3,000,000
- Next IDR 190M (60M-250M) taxed at 15% = IDR 28,500,000
- Next IDR 50M (250M-300M) taxed at 25% = IDR 12,500,000
- **Total tax: IDR 44,000,000** (effective rate: ~14.7%)

## Tax Treaties: Avoiding Double Taxation

Indonesia has <GlossaryTerm term="Tax Treaty" definition="Perjanjian Penghindaran Pajak Berganda (P3B) - agreements between Indonesia and other countries to prevent the same income being taxed twice." indonesian="Perjanjian Penghindaran Pajak Berganda">tax treaties</GlossaryTerm> with over 70 countries to prevent double taxation. If your home country has a treaty with Indonesia, you may benefit from:

- **Reduced withholding rates** on dividends, interest, royalties
- **Tax credits** for Indonesian taxes paid
- **Tie-breaker rules** for residency conflicts

3. **Documentation** - Proof that you're the beneficial owner of the income

Submit these to the Indonesian payer before payment to ensure correct withholding.

## Special Tax Situations

### Remote Workers / Digital Nomads

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Digital Nomad Tax Gray Area">
Indonesia doesn't have a specific "digital nomad" tax regime. Technically:

- Work performed in Indonesia = potentially Indonesian-source income
- 183+ days = tax resident, worldwide income taxable
- Tourist visas don't change tax obligations

**Reality**: Many digital nomads don't register. This is a risk. The tax office is increasingly aware of remote workers.

**Safest approach**: Stay under 183 days, or consider voluntary registration if staying longer.
</InfoCard>

### Second Home Visa Holders

The new **Second Home Visa** (5-10 years) doesn't automatically create tax residency, but:
- 183+ days still triggers residency
- You may need to prove income isn't from Indonesia
- Consider voluntary NPWP registration for banking/property

### Expatriates on Assignment

If your home country employer assigns you to Indonesia:
- Usually become Indonesian tax resident
- May be eligible for **tax equalization** (employer covers difference)
- Check for **hypothetical tax** arrangements
- Coordinate with home and host country tax advisors

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<InfoCard variant="error" title="Tax Mistakes That Cost Money">
**1. Not Getting NPWP**
20% tax markup without NPWP. Get it as soon as you become a resident.

**2. Missing Filing Deadline**
SPT due March 31. Late = penalties. Set a reminder.

**3. Ignoring Foreign Income**
Residents must report worldwide income. Foreign bank accounts, investments, rental income—all taxable.

**4. Wrong Form Type**
Using 1770SS when you have multiple income sources. Use correct form for your situation.

**5. Not Claiming Treaty Benefits**
If you're taxed at 20% but your country has a treaty for 10%, you're overpaying.

**6. No Records**
Keep payslips, Bukti Potong, bank statements for 10 years. Tax office can audit.
