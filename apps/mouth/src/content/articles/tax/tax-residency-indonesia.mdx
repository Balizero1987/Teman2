# Tax Residency in Indonesia: When Do You Become a Tax Resident? 2026

Tax residency determines how Indonesia taxes your income. Residents pay tax on worldwide income; non-residents only on Indonesian-source income. Knowing your status is crucial.

## The Two Tests

Indonesia uses two main tests for tax residency:

  items={[
    {
      name: "183-Day Rule",

      values: {
        "Test": "Present 183+ days in any 12-month period",
        "Period": "Rolling 12 months (not calendar year)",
        "Automatic?": "Yes - triggers residency",
        "Most Common": "Yes"
      },
      highlight: true
    },
    {
      name: "Intention Test",

      values: {
        "Test": "Intend to stay in Indonesia",
        "Period": "From date of intention",
        "Automatic?": "Subjective - based on circumstances",
        "Most Common": "No - supplementary"

## The 183-Day Rule in Detail

<InfoCard variant="important" title="How Days Are Counted">
- **Both entry and exit days count** as full days
- **Rolling 12 months** - not calendar year
- **Any 12-month period** that includes 183+ days triggers residency
- **Days don't need to be consecutive**

Example: If you arrive Oct 1, 2024 and spend 183+ days in Indonesia by Sep 30, 2026, you become a tax resident.

### Day Counting Example

<Calculator
  title="183-Day Calculator"
  description="Calculate your days in Indonesia"
  fields={[
    {
      id: "days-so-far",
      label: "Days in Indonesia (past 12 months)",
      type: "number",
      defaultValue: 120,
      min: 0,
      max: 365
    },
    {
      id: "planned-days",
      label: "Planned additional days",
      type: "number",
      defaultValue: 60,
      min: 0,
      max: 365
    }
  ]}
  calculateResult={(values) => {
    const total = Number(values['days-so-far']) + Number(values['planned-days']);
    const threshold = 183;
    const margin = threshold - total;

    const breakdown = [
      { label: "Days so far", amount: Number(values['days-so-far']) },
      { label: "Planned days", amount: Number(values['planned-days']) },
      { label: "Total days", amount: total }
    ];

    let note = "";
    if (total >= 183) {
      note = `At ${total} days, you WILL be a tax resident. Consider implications.`;
    } else {
      note = `At ${total} days, you're under the threshold. ${margin} day buffer remaining.`;
    }

    return {
      total,
      breakdown,
      currency: "days",
      note
    };
