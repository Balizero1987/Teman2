## International Freelancers

If you're a tax resident freelancing for **international clients only**:

### Your Obligations
1. Register for NPWP
2. Report income on annual SPT (Form 1770)
3. Pay tax on worldwide income
4. Can claim foreign tax credits

### Tax Calculation

<Calculator
  title="Freelancer Tax Calculator"
  description="Estimate your annual tax on freelance income"
  fields={[
    {
      id: "annual",
      label: "Annual Freelance Income (IDR)",
      type: "number",
      defaultValue: 300000000,
      min: 0,
      step: 10000000,
      suffix: "IDR"
    },
    {
      id: "expenses",
      label: "Business Expenses (IDR)",
      type: "number",
      defaultValue: 50000000,
      min: 0,
      step: 5000000,
      suffix: "IDR"
    },
    {
      id: "status",
      label: "PTKP Status",
      type: "select",
      options: [
        { value: "TK0", label: "Single (TK/0)" },
        { value: "K0", label: "Married (K/0)" },
        { value: "K1", label: "Married + 1 child" },
        { value: "K2", label: "Married + 2 children" }
      ],
      defaultValue: "TK0"
    }
  ]}
  calculateResult={(values) => {
    const income = Number(values.annual);
    const expenses = Number(values.expenses);
    const net = income - expenses;

    const ptkpMap = { 'TK0': 54000000, 'K0': 58500000, 'K1': 63000000, 'K2': 67500000 };
    const ptkp = ptkpMap[values.status];

    let taxable = Math.max(0, net - ptkp);
    let tax = 0;
    let remaining = taxable;

    if (remaining > 0) { const b1 = Math.min(remaining, 60000000); tax += b1 * 0.05; remaining -= b1; }
    if (remaining > 0) { const b2 = Math.min(remaining, 190000000); tax += b2 * 0.15; remaining -= b2; }
    if (remaining > 0) { const b3 = Math.min(remaining, 250000000); tax += b3 * 0.25; remaining -= b3; }
    if (remaining > 0) { const b4 = Math.min(remaining, 4500000000); tax += b4 * 0.30; remaining -= b4; }
    if (remaining > 0) { tax += remaining * 0.35; }

    const effectiveRate = net > 0 ? ((tax / net) * 100).toFixed(1) : 0;

    return {
      total: tax,
      breakdown: [
        { label: "Gross Income", amount: income },
        { label: "Expenses", amount: -expenses },
        { label: "Net Income", amount: net },
        { label: "PTKP Deduction", amount: -ptkp },
        { label: "Taxable Income", amount: taxable },
        { label: "Annual Tax", amount: tax }
      ],
      currency: "IDR",
      note: `Effective tax rate on net income: ${effectiveRate}%`
    };
  }}
/>

## Indonesian Clients

If you have **Indonesian clients**, they're required to withhold tax:

### PPh 21 or PPh 23?

| Situation | Tax Type | Rate |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Individual freelancer providing services | PPh 21 | Progressive (5-35%) |
| Services to company | PPh 23 | 2% of gross |
| Technical/management/consulting | PPh 23 | 2% of gross |

<InfoCard variant="note" title="PPh 23 is Not Final">
PPh 23 (2%) is a **prepayment**, not final tax. You must still file SPT and may owe additional tax or get a refund depending on total income.
</InfoCard>
