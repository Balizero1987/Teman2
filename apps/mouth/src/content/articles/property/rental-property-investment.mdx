## Return Expectations

### Typical Yields

| Property Type | Gross Yield | Net Yield |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Bali villa (short-term) | 8-15% | 5-10% |
| Bali villa (long-term) | 5-8% | 4-6% |
| Jakarta apartment | 5-7% | 4-5% |
| Serviced apartment | 6-10% | 4-7% |

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Realistic Expectations">
**Be realistic:**

- Gross yields ignore expenses
- Net yields matter more
- Occupancy varies (60-80% typical for short-term)
- Maintenance costs add up
- Management fees 15-25%
- Tax reduces returns further

Target 5-8% net return for realistic planning.
