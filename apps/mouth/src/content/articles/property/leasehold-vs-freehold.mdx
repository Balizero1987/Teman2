## What is Freehold (Hak Milik)?

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Indonesian Freehold">
**Hak Milik** is the strongest property right in Indonesia:
- Perpetual ownership
- Inheritable without limit
- Full disposal rights
- Only for Indonesian citizens (individual or legal entities)
</InfoCard>

### Who Can Hold Hak Milik?
- Indonesian citizens
- Certain Indonesian legal entities
- Religious organizations (for places of worship)

### NOT Available To:
- Foreigners (any nationality)
- Foreign companies (including PT PMA)
- Dual citizens (must choose nationality)

---

## What is Leasehold?

Leasehold is a contractual right to use property for a specified period:

### How It Works
1. Indonesian owner retains **Hak Milik** (freehold)
2. Lessee gets exclusive use rights via **Sewa** (lease) agreement
3. Lease can be registered with BPN (land office)
4. At end of term, property returns to owner

### Typical Terms
- **Duration**: 25-30 years common, up to 99 years possible
- **Extensions**: Often pre-negotiated
- **Building rights**: Usually included
- **Transfer**: May require owner consent

## Leasehold Value Depreciation

<Calculator

    {
      id: "original",
      label: "Original Lease Value (IDR)",

    },

      type: "number",
      defaultValue: 20,
      min: 0,
      max: 99
    }
  ]}
  calculateResult={(values) => {
    const original = Number(values.original);
    const total = Number(values.totalYears);
    const remaining = Number(values.yearsRemaining);

    // Simple linear depreciation
    const ratio = remaining / total;
    const currentValue = original * ratio;
    const depreciation = original - currentValue;
    const annualDepreciation = original / total;

    return {
      total: currentValue,
      breakdown: [
        { label: "Original Value", amount: original },
        { label: "Total Depreciation", amount: -depreciation },
        { label: "Current Estimated Value", amount: currentValue },
        { label: "Annual Depreciation", amount: annualDepreciation }
      ],
      currency: "IDR",
      note: `Lease has depreciated ${Math.round((1 - ratio) * 100)}% of original value`
    };
  }}
/>

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Value Decreases Over Time">
Unlike freehold which typically appreciates, leasehold value decreases as the remaining term shortens. A 5-year remaining lease is worth much less than a 25-year lease.

## Leasehold Terms to Negotiate

### Essential Terms

| Term | What to Negotiate |
|------|------------------|
| Duration | Longest possible (25+ years minimum) |
| Extension | Pre-agreed renewal options |
| Building rights | Right to build, modify, demolish |
| Transfer rights | Can you assign or sell the lease? |
| Subletting | Can you rent to others? |
| Early termination | What triggers it? |
| Inheritance | What happens if you die? |

### Registration

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="Register Your Lease">
Have your lease registered at the local **BPN (Land Office)**. This provides:
- Public record of your rights
- Protection against third-party claims
- Easier enforcement
- Required for certain financing
</InfoCard>

## Leasehold Risks

### Common Problems

1. **Landowner disputes** - Heirs may challenge lease

## Market Reality

### In Bali

- **Most sales to foreigners are leasehold**
- Typical: 25-30 year initial terms
- Extensions usually negotiated upfront
- Prices quoted as "leasehold value"
- "Freehold" listings are usually nominee (illegal)

### Price Difference

Approximate comparison for similar properties:
- **Freehold land**: IDR 100M per are
- **Leasehold (25 years)**: IDR 50-60M per are (50-60% of freehold)

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Location Matters">
In prime tourist areas, leasehold can still command premium prices due to limited supply and high demand. Value is in location and rental potential, not just ownership type.
</InfoCard>

---

## Exit Strategy

When you want to exit a leasehold:

### Options
1. **Sell the lease** - If transfer allowed
2. **Wait for expiry** - Get back any deposit
3. **Negotiate buyout** - With landowner
4. **Sublease** - If permitted

### Challenges
- Short remaining term = low value
- May need landowner consent
- Finding buyers can be difficult
- No capital appreciation
