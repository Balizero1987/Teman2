# Rental Income Tax in Indonesia 2026: Landlord Guide

If you rent out property in Indonesia, you need to understand how rental income is taxed. Here's what property owners need to know.

## Rental Income Tax Overview

<InfoCard variant="note" title="10% Final Tax">
Rental income from land and buildings in Indonesia is subject to **10% final income tax (PPh Final)** on the gross rental amount.

"Final" means this is the complete tax - you don't add it to your other income for progressive rates.
</InfoCard>

---

## How It Works

### Tax Rate and Base

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Tax rate | 10% |
| Tax base | Gross rent received |
| Tax type | PPh Final (Article 4(2)) |
| Deductions | None allowed |

### Important Points
- Calculated on **gross rent** (no expense deductions)
- **Final** tax - not combined with other income
- Applies to all types of rental (residential, commercial)
- Same rate for individuals and companies

    };
  }}

## Who Collects the Tax?

### Corporate Tenants (Withholding)

If your tenant is a company (tax subject):
1. Tenant withholds 10% from rent payment
2. Tenant pays the tax to the government
3. Tenant gives you **Bukti Potong** (tax slip)
4. You receive net rent (90%)

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Bukti Potong is Your Proof">
The Bukti Potong proves your tax was paid. Keep it for your records and include in your annual tax return.
</InfoCard>

### Individual Tenants (Self-Pay)

If your tenant is an individual:
1. You receive full rent (100%)
2. **You** must pay 10% tax
3. Pay via bank or tax office
4. Report in annual tax return

## Villa Rental Taxation

For short-term/vacation rentals:

### Tax Applies to Each Rental
- 10% on each rental payment
- Applies even to nightly rates
- Management company may collect and pay

### If Using Management Company

Many villa owners use management companies that:
1. Collect rent from guests
2. Withhold and pay 10% tax
3. Provide you with documentation
4. Handle reporting

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="Clarify Tax Handling">
When hiring a villa management company, clarify:
- Who pays the 10% rental tax?
- Will they provide Bukti Potong?
- Is tax included in their fee structure?
</InfoCard>

---

## Other Property Taxes

Besides rental income tax, property owners also pay:

### PBB (Land and Building Tax)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Rate | 0.1% - 0.3% of NJOP |
| Frequency | Annual |
| Payment | By August 31 |
| Who pays | Property owner |

**NJOP** = Nilai Jual Objek Pajak (taxable value, often below market)

### BPHTB (Transfer Tax)
- 5% when buying property
- Paid by buyer
- One-time at purchase

---

## Foreign Owner Considerations

### If You're Tax Resident

Report rental income on your annual SPT (Form 1770):
- Include in income section
- Report tax already paid
- No additional tax (it's final)

### If You're Non-Resident

- 10% final tax still applies
- May have treaty implications
- Consider getting DGT form for reduced withholding on other income

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Don't Ignore Rental Tax">
Failing to pay rental income tax can result in:
- Back taxes plus interest
- Penalties up to 200%
- Issues with future property transactions
- Problems with visa renewal (if applicable)
</InfoCard>

---

## Record Keeping

Keep these records:
- Rental agreements
- Payment receipts from tenants
- Bukti Potong from corporate tenants
- Tax payment receipts (NTPN)
- Property ownership documents

**Retention**: Keep for 10 years (tax audit period)
