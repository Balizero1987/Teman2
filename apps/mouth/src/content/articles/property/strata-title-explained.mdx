# Strata Title in Indonesia 2025: What Apartment Buyers Need to Know

When you buy an apartment in Indonesia, you receive a strata title - a unique form of ownership. Here's how it works.

## What is Strata Title?

<GlossaryTerm
  term="SHMSRS"
  definition="Sertifikat Hak Milik Satuan Rumah Susun - the official strata title certificate that proves ownership of an apartment unit in Indonesia."
/>

Strata title is a system that allows individual ownership of units within a multi-unit building while sharing ownership of common areas.

### Key Concepts
- **Unit ownership**: You own your specific apartment
- **Common property**: Shared ownership of building facilities
- **Proportional share**: Based on unit size/value
- **Body corporate**: Building management structure (P3SRS)

## What You Own

<ComparisonTable
  title="Ownership Under Strata Title"
  description="What's yours vs what's shared"
  items={[
    {
      name: "Your Unit (Private)",
      subtitle: "Exclusive ownership",
      values: {
        "Internal space": "100% yours",
        "Fixtures inside": "Yours",
        "Modifications": "With approval",
        "Can sell": "Yes"
      },
      highlight: true
    },
    {
      name: "Common Property",
      subtitle: "Shared ownership",
      values: {
        "Land": "Proportional share",
        "Structure": "Proportional share",
        "Facilities": "Equal access",
        "Can sell": "Only with unit"
      }
    }
  ]}
/>

### Private (Unit) Ownership
- Interior space within walls
- Doors and windows
- Internal fixtures
- Flooring within unit
- Internal walls (non-structural)

### Common Property
- Land the building sits on
- Building structure (walls, roof, foundation)
- Corridors, lobbies, stairs
- Elevators
- Swimming pool, gym, gardens
- Parking structure
- Security and maintenance facilities

## Strata Title Certificate

The SHMSRS certificate shows:

### Certificate Information
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Owner name | Your name as registered owner |
| Unit number | Specific apartment identification |
| Building name | The development |
| Floor area | Size of your unit (sqm) |
| Proportional value | Your share of common property |
| Land rights | Underlying land title (usually HGB) |

<InfoCard variant="note" title="For Foreigners">
Foreigners with KITAS/KITAP can hold strata title with **Hak Pakai** status rather than **Hak Milik** status. The certificate will reflect this.
</InfoCard>

## Rights and Responsibilities

### Your Rights as Unit Owner

1. **Exclusive use** of your unit
2. **Access** to common facilities
3. **Vote** in owners' meetings
4. **Rent out** your unit (usually)

## Building Management

### P3SRS (Management Body)

<GlossaryTerm
  term="P3SRS"
  definition="Perhimpunan Pemilik dan Penghuni Satuan Rumah Susun - the Owners and Residents Association that manages the building, similar to a strata corporation or HOA."
/>

    {
      name: "PPJB",
      subtitle: "Sale & Purchase Agreement",
      values: {
        "What it is": "Contract only",
        "Ownership": "Not yet transferred",

/>

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="PPJB Risk">
If buying from PPJB only (before strata title issued):
- Developer may fail to complete
- Building may have issues
- Strata title may be delayed
- Limited legal protection

Prefer units where SHMSRS already exists.
</InfoCard>

## Underlying Land Rights

The building sits on land - usually HGB (Building Rights):

### Duration
- HGB: 30+20+30 years = 80 years total
- Your strata title follows the underlying land right

### What Happens at Expiry?
- Land right must be extended
- All owners apply together (via P3SRS)
- Usually granted if in good standing
- Costs shared among owners

---

## Common Issues

### Service Charge Disputes
- Increases can be contested
- P3SRS must follow proper procedures
- Non-payment can result in legal action

### Building Rule Violations
- Unauthorized renovations
- Noise complaints
- Short-term rental restrictions
- Pet policies

### Developer Issues
- Delayed strata title issuance
- Defects in common areas
- Failed handover to P3SRS
