# Land Ownership in Indonesia 2025: Rules for Foreigners

Indonesian land law is based on the 1960 Basic Agrarian Law (UUPA) which establishes different types of land rights. Understanding these is essential for any property transaction.

## The Fundamental Rule

<InfoCard variant="error" title="Foreigners Cannot Own Land">
**UUPA Article 21**: Hak Milik (freehold ownership) can only be held by Indonesian citizens. This is a constitutional principle, not just a regulation.

However, foreigners can access land through other legal rights.
