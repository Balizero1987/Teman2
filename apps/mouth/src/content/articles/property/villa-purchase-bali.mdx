# Buying a Villa in Bali 2025: Foreigner's Guide

Owning a villa in Bali is a dream for many. Here's everything you need to know to make it a reality.

## Can Foreigners Buy?

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="The Short Answer">
**Foreigners cannot own freehold land in Indonesia.**

But there are legal ways to secure property:
- **Leasehold** (long-term lease)
- **Hak Pakai** (right to use - for personal residence)
- **PT PMA** (company ownership)

Each has pros and cons - choose based on your situation.
