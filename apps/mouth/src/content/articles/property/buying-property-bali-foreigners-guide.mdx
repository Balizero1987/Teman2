# Buying Property in Bali: What Foreigners Can (and Can't) Do

Let's start with the hard truth: **foreigners cannot own freehold land in Indonesia**. This includes Bali. No exceptions, no workarounds that are fully legal and risk-free.

But this doesn't mean foreigners can't invest in Indonesian real estate. There are legitimate pathways—each with trade-offs. This guide explains your options honestly, covering the risks most agents won't tell you about.

## The Fundamental Truth

<InfoCard variant="error" title="Critical Legal Fact">
Under Indonesian Agrarian Law (UUPA 1960), only Indonesian citizens can hold **Hak Milik** (freehold ownership) of land.

This is not a rule that can be bypassed with clever legal structures. Any arrangement claiming to give a foreigner "effective freehold" is operating in a legal gray area with significant risks.

Understanding this foundation is essential before exploring your options.

## Option 1: Hak Pakai (Right to Use)

<GlossaryTerm
  term="Hak Pakai"
  definition="Right to Use - A land right that allows foreigners to use and enjoy land for residential purposes for up to 80 years."
  indonesian="Hak Pakai"
  relatedTerms={["Hak Milik", "HGB", "PPAT"]}
>Hak Pakai</GlossaryTerm> is the **most legitimate way** for foreigners to hold property rights in Indonesia.

### Who Can Get Hak Pakai?

Foreigners with:
- KITAS (work, investor, spouse, retirement)
- KITAP (permanent resident)
- Second Home Visa (5-10 year)
- Diplomatic/consular status

### How It Works

1. **Find property** with clean Hak Milik certificate
2. **Negotiate purchase** with owner
3. **Convert** from Hak Milik to Hak Pakai (landowner releases Hak Milik; you receive Hak Pakai)
4. **Register** at local Land Office (BPN)

<ComparisonTable
  title="Hak Pakai Terms"
  description="Duration and extension rules for Hak Pakai"
  items={[
    {
      name: "Initial Term",
      values: { "Duration": "30 years", "Requirements": "Valid visa, property min. values", "Process": "Registration at BPN" }
    },
    {
      name: "First Extension",
      values: { "Duration": "+20 years", "Requirements": "Valid visa, land still in use", "Process": "Apply before expiry" }
    },
    {

    }
  ]}
/>

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Hak Pakai Minimum Values">
Government regulations set **minimum property values** for foreign Hak Pakai:

| Location | House/Villa | Apartment |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Bali | IDR 5 billion | IDR 2 billion |
| Jakarta | IDR 5 billion | IDR 3 billion |
| Other major cities | IDR 3 billion | IDR 1 billion |
| Other areas | IDR 2 billion | IDR 750 million |

*Values as of PP 18/2021 - verify current requirements*
</InfoCard>

### Pros and Cons

**Advantages:**
- Legitimate, legally recognized
- Can mortgage property
- Can sell or transfer
- Long term (up to 80 years)
- Registered at Land Office

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires valid long-term visa
- Minimum value requirements
- Conversion costs
- Not true freehold
- Must extend periodically

---

## Option 2: Leasehold (Hak Sewa)

Leasehold is a **contractual arrangement** where you rent land from an Indonesian owner for an extended period.

### How Leasehold Works

1. **Find landowner** with Hak Milik willing to lease long-term
2. **Negotiate lease** (typically 25-30 years)
3. **Pay lease upfront** (common practice)
4. **Build or buy** the building on the land
5. **Notarize contract** and optionally register

## Option 3: PT PMA Ownership

A <GlossaryTerm term="PT PMA" definition="Perseroan Terbatas Penanaman Modal Asing - A foreign-invested limited liability company in Indonesia." indonesian="Perseroan Terbatas Penanaman Modal Asing" relatedTerms={["HGB", "KBLI", "OSS"]}>PT PMA</GlossaryTerm> (foreign investment company) can hold property rights through HGB (Building Rights).

### When PT PMA Makes Sense

- Villa rental business
- Property development
- Commercial property needs
- Multiple property investment
- Estate planning (company shares easier to transfer)

### How It Works

1. **Establish PT PMA** with appropriate KBLI codes
2. **Company acquires HGB** on land
3. **Build or buy** property through company
4. **Company operates** rental or development business
5. **You control** through shareholding

## What to Avoid: The Nominee Trap

<InfoCard variant="error" title="ILLEGAL: Nominee Arrangements">
A "nominee" structure is where an Indonesian holds Hak Milik in their name, but you're the "real" owner through side agreements.

**This is ILLEGAL** under Indonesian law. Article 26(2) of the Agrarian Law voids any arrangement designed to circumvent foreign ownership restrictions.

**Risks:**
- The nominee legally owns everything
- Side agreements are unenforceable
- Nominee can sell without your consent
- You have no legal recourse
- Criminal penalties possible for both parties

**No matter how much you trust someone—don't do this.**
</InfoCard>

Every year, foreigners lose properties because:
- The "trusted" nominee dies and family claims property
- The nominee divorces and spouse claims property
- The nominee has debts and property is seized
- The nominee simply decides to keep it

There is **no safe nominee structure**. Anyone telling you otherwise is either uninformed or dishonest.
