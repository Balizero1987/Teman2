# Land Ownership Rules Indonesia 2026: Foreigner Guide

Foreigners cannot directly own freehold land in Indonesia. However, there are legal ways to secure property rights. Here's your complete guide.

## The Basic Rule

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Fundamental Restriction">
**Indonesian law (Agrarian Law 1960):**

- Only Indonesian citizens can hold **Hak Milik** (freehold)
- Foreigners can hold certain **use rights**
- Land automatically reverts to state if foreigner holds Hak Milik

This is constitutional law - it cannot be bypassed legally.
</InfoCard>

### Minimum Property Values

| Region | Minimum Value |
|--------|---------------|
| Bali | IDR 5 billion |
| Jakarta | IDR 10 billion |
| Other Java | IDR 5 billion |
| Other regions | IDR 2-5 billion |

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Hak Pakai Duration">
**Hak Pakai term:** 30 + 20 + 20 years = 70 years total

Extensions are subject to:
- Continued valid stay permit
- Land used as intended
- No violations
- Application before expiry
</InfoCard>

---

## PT PMA Structure

### How It Works

1. **Establish PT PMA** - Foreign investment company
2. **Register property activity** - In business license
3. **Acquire HGB title** - Company holds title
4. **You control company** - Indirect ownership

### Advantages

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Commercial use | Can rent out property |
| Multiple properties | No single-property limit |
| Business operations | Full commercial activities |
| Transferable | Sell shares, not property |
| Bank financing | Easier to obtain |

### Disadvantages

| Challenge | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Setup cost | IDR 100-200M+ |
| Ongoing compliance | Reporting, tax |
| Capital requirements | Minimum investment |
| Complexity | Legal and admin burden |
| Running costs | Accounting, licenses |

---

## Leasehold Arrangements

### Long-Term Lease

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="Simpler Alternative">
**Leasehold (Hak Sewa)** is often simpler:

- Lease land from Indonesian owner
- Typical terms: 25-30 years
- Can build with permission
- Lower complexity than PT PMA
- No minimum value requirements

Many expats prefer this for simplicity.
</InfoCard>

### Lease Structure

| Element | Typical Terms |
|---------|---------------|
| Duration | 25-30 years |
| Extension | Often negotiable |
| Registration | Notarized agreement |
| Building rights | Usually included |
| Improvements | Revert to owner or compensated |

---

## What About Nominees?

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Nominee Arrangements">
**Nominee = Indonesian holds title for foreigner**

**The truth:**
- Common but **legally risky**
- Land law doesn't recognize nominee
- Nominee can claim true ownership
- Courts may not protect foreigner
- Can be void if challenged

**If you use nominee:**
- Use comprehensive legal agreements
- Understand you have LIMITED protection
- Consider PT PMA instead for security
</InfoCard>

### Nominee Risks

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Nominee claims ownership | May lose property |
| Nominee dies | Inheritance complications |
| Nominee's debts | Property may be seized |
| Nominee divorce | Spouse may claim |
| Legal challenge | Arrangement void |

---

## Apartment/Strata Title

### Better Option for Foreigners

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Strata Title (Hak Milik Sarusun)">
**Apartments are different!**

Foreigners can hold strata title (HMSRS) directly:
- No PT PMA needed
- No KITAS needed (check specific development)
- Minimum value requirements still apply
- Easier transaction process

Many foreigners choose apartments for simplicity.
</InfoCard>

### Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Minimum value | Varies by region |
| Building type | Apartments/strata only |
| Documentation | Passport, purchase agreement |
| Registration | Through developer/BPN |
