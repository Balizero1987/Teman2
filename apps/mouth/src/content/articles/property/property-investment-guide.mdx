Property investment in Indonesia is attractive but complex for foreigners. Understanding what you can legally own is essential before investing.

## The Basic Rule

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Foreigners Cannot Own Land">
Indonesian law (UUPA 1960) prohibits foreigners from owning land outright with **Hak Milik** (freehold title). However, there are legal alternatives that provide varying degrees of ownership and control.

## Hak Pakai for Residential

The most direct way for foreigners to own residential property:

### Requirements
- Valid KITAS or KITAP
- Property in designated areas
- Residential use only
- Minimum value requirements in some areas

### Duration
- **Initial**: 30 years
- **First extension**: 20 years
- **Second extension**: 30 years
- **Total**: 80 years maximum

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Extension Not Automatic">
Extensions must be applied for before expiry. There's no guarantee of extension - it depends on continued eligibility and compliance.
</InfoCard>

### What Happens When You Leave?

If your KITAS/KITAP expires:
1. Must transfer property within 1 year
2. Sell to eligible buyer
3. Convert to Indonesian spouse (if applicable)
4. Risk forfeiture if not transferred

## PT PMA Property Ownership

Using a company to hold property:

### Advantages
- Can own multiple properties
- Commercial and residential possible
- Easier to transfer (sell company shares)
- Inheritance through share transfer
- Can generate rental income as business

### Disadvantages
- Company setup costs (IDR 100M+)
- Annual compliance (tax, reporting)
- Property tax + corporate tax
- Minimum investment requirements
- More complex structure

### Best For
- Multiple properties
- Investment/rental focus
- Commercial properties
- Long-term planning

## Leasehold Explained

The simplest option for foreigners:

### How Leasehold Works
1. Indonesian owner retains title (Hak Milik)
2. You get exclusive use rights
3. Lease registered with land office
4. Duration: typically 25-30 years

### Lease Terms to Negotiate
- **Duration**: Longer is better
- **Extension**: Pre-agreed renewal terms
- **Building rights**: Can you build/renovate?
- **Transfer rights**: Can you sell the lease?
- **Inheritance**: What happens if you die?

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Leasehold Risks">
- You don't own the land
- Landowner disputes possible
- Extension not guaranteed
- Value decreases as lease shortens
- Banks may not accept as collateral
