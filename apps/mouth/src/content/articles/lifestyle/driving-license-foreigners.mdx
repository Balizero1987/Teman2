## The Driving Test

### Written Test

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Computer-Based Test">
The written test is:
- **30 questions** (approximately)
- Multiple choice
- Available in **English** (usually)
- Must pass with **70%+**
- Covers traffic rules, signs, safety

Study the basics - it's not difficult!
</InfoCard>

### Practical Test

| Test | Vehicle | What's Tested |
|------|---------|---------------|
| SIM A | Your car or provided | Figure 8, parking, road |
| SIM C | Provided scooter | Figure 8, slalom, balance |

---

## International Driving Permit (IDP)

### What is an IDP?

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="IDP is NOT a License">
An IDP is a **translation** of your home country license, not a separate license.

You must:
- Have valid home country license
- Carry both IDP AND original license
- Obey local laws
</InfoCard>

### Getting an IDP

Get your IDP **before** coming to Indonesia:

| Country | Where to Get |
|---------|--------------|
| USA | AAA offices |
| UK | Post Office |
| Australia | AAA, RACV |
| Canada | CAA offices |
| EU | Local authority |

Cost: Usually $15-50

### IDP Validity in Indonesia

- **Technically valid** for short stays
- Police may or may not accept it
- Insurance may have issues
- **Motorcycle class** must be specified
- Best used as backup, not primary

---

## The Reality on the Road

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Practical Considerations">
**What actually happens:**

- Many tourists ride scooters without proper license
- Police sometimes stop foreigners
- Fine: ~IDR 250K-500K (negotiable)
- Insurance claims can be denied without license
- Accidents can be complicated

**Recommendation:** Get proper licensing for peace of mind.
</InfoCard>

### If Stopped by Police

1. Stay calm and polite
2. Show documents
3. If no license, fine is likely
4. Don't argue
5. Ask for receipt (tilang)

---

## Scooter Rental Without License

Most rental shops don't check licenses. However:

### Risks

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Police stop | Fine IDR 250-500K |
| Accident | Insurance may not cover |
| Serious accident | Potential legal issues |
| Injury to others | Liability unclear |

### Insurance Note

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Insurance Warning">
Most travel insurance policies require:
- Valid license for the vehicle type
- Following local laws

Without proper license, claims may be **denied**.
</InfoCard>

---

## Costs Summary

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Medical certificate | IDR 150-300K |
| SIM A (car) | IDR 250K |
| SIM C (motorcycle) | IDR 150K |
| Extension | IDR 100-200K |
| Test retake | IDR 50-100K |

---

## Tips for Foreigners

1. **Get SIM C if riding scooters** - Worth the peace of mind
2. **Bring home license** - May help with testing
3. **Go to Denpasar SAMSAT** - Most foreigner-friendly in Bali
4. **Arrive early** - Lines can be long
5. **Bring Indonesian speaker** - Helpful but not required
6. **Practice the test course** - Watch others first
7. **Be patient** - Bureaucracy takes time
