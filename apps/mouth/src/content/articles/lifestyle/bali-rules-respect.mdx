# Bali Is Not a Playground

Bali is a living land with rules, culture, and very clear boundaries.

Yet every year, thousands of people keep doing the same things — as if the island were a law-free paradise.

**Spoiler alert: it isn't.**

## You Can't Treat Sacred Places Like Instagram Sets

<InfoCard variant="error" title="Temple Disrespect = Deportation">
Temples, ceremonies, and rituals are **not tourist attractions**.

Inappropriate clothing, disrespectful behavior, or provocative poses aren't "creative content" — they're **offensive**.

**Consequences:**
- Fines
- Deportation
- Long-term bans from Indonesia
</InfoCard>

---

## You Can't Work Without Permission

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="This Is Still Work">
- Running a business
- DJing at clubs
- Teaching yoga
- Managing social media
- Selling online
- "Just helping out"

**All of this requires the correct visa and work permit.**

Without it? It's illegal. Enforcement is increasing fast, and "I didn't know" won't save you.
</InfoCard>

## You Can't Build Wherever You Want

**No-build zones**, **green zones**, and **agricultural land** are protected.

Illegal construction leads to:
- **Demolitions**
- **Heavy penalties**
- **Total loss of investment**

Zoning checks are not optional — they are survival tools.

## You Can't Drive Like You're Back Home

No valid license? No helmet? No insurance?

Road checks are frequent, and consequences are immediate:

| Violation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| No valid license | Fine + vehicle impound |
| No helmet | Fine |
| No insurance | You pay everything |
| DUI | Arrest + deportation |

## The Bottom Line

<InfoCard variant="highlight" title="Love Means Respect">
Bali **welcomes visitors**.

What it doesn't welcome is **arrogance**.

Loving the island means understanding it — and respecting its rules.
