# Bali Takes Bold Action: The Kerobokan Kelod Traffic Trial

As Bali prepares for **2.8 million tourists** arriving for Christmas and New Year, Badung's Transportation Agency (DISHUB) has launched an ambitious experiment: a one-month trial to completely reimagine traffic flow in **Kerobokan Kelod**, one of Bali's most critical congestion hotspots.

---

## Why This Area?

Kerobokan Kelod represents the epicenter of the island's traffic chaos:

- **Extremely high vehicle density**
- **Constant commuter movement**
- **Three key zones lacking traffic signals**

Without intervention, escalating congestion threatened to paralyze the entire area.

## What's Changed

<InfoCard variant="highlight" title="The New Traffic Scheme">
**Three key intersections** are now operating under a new system:

- **One-way road adjustments**
- **Redesigned redirections** at major junctions
- **Fresh traffic signage**
- **Traffic officers on the streets** actively directing vehicles

This is not theoretical — it's **live and being tested in real-time** during the most intense tourist period.

## The Bigger Picture

Bali is seriously tackling infrastructure pressure with massive plans:

| Project | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Bypass Ring Road** (Sunset Road to Canggu) | Planned |
| **LRT/Metro/Airport connections** | Proposed |
| **Ngurah Rai expansion** (OWK to GWK) | In progress |

With **6.5 million tourists expected in 2026**, the urgency is palpable.

## What Happens Next?

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Decision Time">
After one month, the **Traffic & Road Transport Forum** will decide:

1. **Permanent implementation**
2. **Revision and adjustment**
3. **Full cancellation**

The ultimate goal? Let residents actually **live in Bali**, not sit in traffic.
</InfoCard>

## Why This Matters for Business

For anyone running a business here, staying informed about these regulatory and infrastructure changes isn't optional — **it's strategic necessity**.

Changes in traffic flow affect:
- **Customer accessibility**
- **Delivery logistics**
- **Staff commute times**
- **Property values**
