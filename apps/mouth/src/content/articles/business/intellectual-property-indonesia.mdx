## Trademark Registration

### Why Register in Indonesia?

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="First-to-File System">
Indonesia uses **first-to-file** system:
- First to register owns the trademark
- Your trademark elsewhere doesn't protect you here
- "Squatters" may register your brand first
- Without registration, limited enforcement

**Register your trademark before entering Indonesia market!**
</InfoCard>
