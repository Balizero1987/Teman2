<InfoCard variant="important" title="Important: The IDR 10 Billion Requirement">
The minimum investment for PT PMA is **IDR 10 billion** (~$625,000 USD). This doesn't mean you need to deposit this amount immediately—it's the total planned investment over the life of the company, including:
- Paid-up share capital
- Loans to the company
- Fixed assets and equipment
- Working capital

Your **paid-up capital** (actual cash deposited) must also be IDR 10 billion minimum.

## Understanding KBLI Codes

<GlossaryTerm
  term="KBLI"
  definition="Klasifikasi Baku Lapangan Usaha Indonesia - the Indonesian Standard Industrial Classification system using 5-digit codes."
  indonesian="Klasifikasi Baku Lapangan Usaha Indonesia"
  relatedTerms={["NIB", "OSS", "DNI"]}
>KBLI codes</GlossaryTerm> are perhaps the most important element of your PT PMA setup. They determine:

- **What activities you can legally perform**
- **Whether foreigners can own 100%** (or less)
- **What permits you need**
- **Your risk classification**

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="KBLI Selection Tips">
1. **Be comprehensive** - Add all activities you might do, including support activities
2. **Check the DNI list** - Some codes have foreign ownership caps
3. **Primary vs secondary** - Your main code affects tax treatment
4. **Future-proof** - Adding codes later requires amendments (cost and time)
</InfoCard>

### Popular KBLI Codes for Foreign Companies

| Code | Activity | Foreign Ownership |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| 62010 | Computer Programming | 100% |
| 62020 | IT Consulting | 100% |
| 70201 | Business Consulting | 100% |
| 46100 | Wholesale Trade (agent) | 100% |
| 55111 | 5-Star Hotel | 100% |
| 56101 | Restaurant (large scale) | 100% |
| 73100 | Advertising | 100% |
| 74100 | Design Activities | 100% |

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Restricted Activities">
Some activities are **closed** to foreign investment or have ownership caps:
- Small retail (reserved for MSME)
- Small restaurants (reserved for MSME)
- Travel agencies (49% foreign cap)
- Some media and broadcasting
- Land transportation

Always verify current DNI (Negative Investment List) status before finalizing KBLI codes.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<InfoCard variant="error" title="Critical Mistakes">
**1. Nominee Arrangements**
Using an Indonesian's name to hold shares is **illegal**. The real owner can lose everything, and the nominee can claim the assets.

**2. Underestimating Capital**
The IDR 10 billion isn't just a number—you need to show investment activity. Plan realistic capital deployment.

**3. Wrong KBLI Codes**
Choosing codes without checking restrictions can limit your business or ownership percentage.

**4. Skipping Permits**
Operating without proper licenses can result in fines, closure, or visa cancellation.

**5. Tax Non-Compliance**
Indonesia tracks foreign companies closely. Late filings = penalties. No filing = big trouble.
