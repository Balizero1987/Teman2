# OSS System: Online Business Registration Made Easy 2025

OSS (Online Single Submission) is Indonesia's integrated online platform for all business registrations and permits. It's your one-stop-shop for NIB, business licenses, and operational permits.

## What Is OSS?

OSS replaced the old system of visiting multiple government offices. Now, virtually all business permits flow through this single platform at **oss.go.id**.

### OSS Evolution

| Version | Period | Key Features |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| OSS 1.0 | 2018-2020 | Initial launch |
| OSS 1.1 | 2020-2021 | Improvements |
| **OSS RBA** | 2021-Present | Risk-Based Approach, current system |

## Risk-Based Approach (RBA)

OSS uses a risk-based system to determine what permits you need:

<InfoCard variant="note" title="How Risk is Determined">
Your **KBLI codes** determine risk level:

- **Low Risk**: Basic activities (consulting, IT services) - NIB only
- **Medium-Low**: Some compliance needed - NIB + Sertifikat Standar
- **Medium-High**: Verification required - NIB + Sertifikat Standar + Inspection
- **High Risk**: Full licensing - NIB + Izin + Regular audits

The system automatically classifies when you select your KBLI codes.
