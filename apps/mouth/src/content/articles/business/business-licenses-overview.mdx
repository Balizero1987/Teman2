# Business Licenses in Indonesia 2026: Complete Overview

Indonesia has streamlined business licensing through the OSS (Online Single Submission) system, but understanding what you need can still be complex.

## Licensing Framework

<InfoCard variant="note" title="OSS System">
Since the **Job Creation Law (Omnibus Law)**, Indonesia uses the **OSS RBA** (Risk-Based Approach) system:

- All businesses register through OSS
- Receive **NIB** (Nomor Induk Berusaha)
- Risk level determines further requirements
- Sectoral licenses integrated into OSS
</InfoCard>
