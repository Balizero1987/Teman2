# PT PMA Capital Requirements Indonesia 2026: Investment Guide

Understanding capital requirements is crucial for foreign investors in Indonesia. Here's what you need to know.

## Capital Structure Overview

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Two Types of Capital">
**PT PMA has two capital figures:**

1. **Authorized Capital** (Modal Dasar) - Maximum capital company can have
2. **Paid-up Capital** (Modal Disetor) - Actually invested capital

Both have minimum requirements for foreign investment.
</InfoCard>

## Current Requirements

### Standard PT PMA Minimums

| Capital Type | Minimum Amount |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Total Investment** | IDR 10 billion (~USD 625,000) |
| **Paid-up Capital** | IDR 10 billion (must match total investment now) |
| **Per Shareholder** | IDR 10 million minimum |

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="2021 Changes">
**Important change:**

Under current regulations, the paid-up capital must equal the total investment commitment. This means you need to actually have and invest IDR 10 billion minimum.

This is a significant increase from earlier requirements.
