## Adventure Tourism

Special considerations for adventure activities:

### Diving Operations

- **PADI/SSI affiliation** - Certification required
- **Dive safety officer** - Trained staff
- **Equipment standards** - Regular maintenance
- **Insurance** - Dive-specific coverage
- **Rescue readiness** - Emergency protocols

### Water Sports

- **Surfing schools** - Instructor certifications
- **Rafting operators** - River permits, safety gear
- **Snorkeling tours** - Guide training, equipment

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Safety First">
Adventure tourism carries liability risks. Proper insurance, certified guides, and safety protocols are essential - not just for compliance but for your protection.
</InfoCard>

## Villa Rental Challenges

<InfoCard variant="error" title="Villa Rental Restrictions">
Small-scale villa rental is one of the most restricted areas for foreigners:
- Many areas prohibit foreign-owned Pondok Wisata
- Bali has specific regulations limiting foreign villa operations
- "Nominee" arrangements are illegal and risky
- Leasing land + building villa has ownership complications
</InfoCard>

### Villa Options for Foreigners

1. **Hotel classification** (15+ units) - Possible with PT PMA
2. **Property management** - Manage others' villas
3. **Joint venture** - With Indonesian partner (risky)
4. **Leasehold investment** - Limited control

---

## Travel Agency (BPW)

Full travel agencies can:
- Book airline tickets
- Arrange hotel reservations
- Create package tours
- Handle ticketing

### BPW Requirements

- PT PMA with travel agency KBLI
- TDUP for travel agency
- Proof of financial capability
- Licensed staff
