## Language Requirements

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Indonesian Language Law">
Under **Law 24/2009**, contracts involving Indonesian parties **should be in Indonesian**.

**Practical approach:**
- Bilingual contracts (Indonesian + English)
- Indonesian version prevails if conflict
- Include clause stating which version governs

Ignoring this can create enforcement issues.
</InfoCard>

### Best Practice

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Both parties Indonesian | Indonesian only |
| One party foreign | Bilingual |
| Both parties foreign | English OK (but Indonesian helps) |
| Employment contract | Must include Indonesian |
