## SPPL (Statement Letter)

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="Simplest Option">
**SPPL** is for low-impact businesses:
- Small retail shops
- Basic services
- Office activities
- Low-risk operations

Often generated automatically through OSS system based on your KBLI code.
</InfoCard>

### SPPL Process

1. Register on OSS system
2. Enter business details
3. SPPL generated if risk is low
4. Print and keep on record
5. Comply with stated commitments

---

## Risk-Based Approach

### OSS Risk Classification

The OSS system now uses **risk-based approach**:

| Risk Level | Environmental Requirement |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Low | SPPL (automatic in OSS) |
| Medium-Low | SPPL or simplified UKL-UPL |
| Medium-High | UKL-UPL standard |
| High | AMDAL full assessment |

Risk determined by:
- KBLI business classification
- Scale of operations
- Location sensitivity
- Potential environmental impact
