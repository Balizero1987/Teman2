## KBLI Classification

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Choose Carefully">
**KBLI (Klasifikasi Baku Lapangan Usaha Indonesia)** is crucial:

- 5-digit activity codes
- Determines risk classification
- Affects permit requirements
- Must match actual business
- Changes require amendments

Wrong KBLI can mean wrong permits or DNI violations.
</InfoCard>

### Finding KBLI Codes

1. Search in OSS system
2. Check KBLI guide (BPS publication)
3. Consult with notary/agent
4. Match to your business plan

### Common KBLI Examples

| Activity | KBLI Code |
|----------|-----------|
| Restaurant | 56101 |
| Software development | 62012 |
| Trading (general) | 46900 |
| Consulting | 70201 |
| Hotel | 55111 |
| Manufacturing | Various 10xxx-33xxx |

---

## Risk Classification

After entering KBLI, OSS determines risk level:

### Risk Levels

| Level | Requirements | Processing |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Low | NIB only | Instant |
| Medium-Low | NIB + Standard Certificate | Self-declare |
| Medium-High | NIB + Standard Certificate | Verification |
| High | NIB + Permit | Full assessment |

### What Determines Risk?

- Industry sector
- Business scale
- Environmental impact
- Public health/safety
- Security considerations
