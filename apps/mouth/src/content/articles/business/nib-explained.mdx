# NIB Explained: Your Indonesian Business ID Number 2026

The NIB (Nomor Induk Berusaha) is the cornerstone of business registration in Indonesia. Think of it as your company's national ID card—required for virtually everything.

## What Is NIB?

<LegalDecoder
  title="NIB Definition"
  documentRef="PP 5/2021"
  documentType="PP"
  status="active"
  sections={[
    {
      id: "definition",
      original: "Nomor Induk Berusaha yang selanjutnya disingkat NIB adalah identitas Pelaku Usaha yang diterbitkan oleh Lembaga OSS setelah Pelaku Usaha melakukan Pendaftaran.",
      explanation: "NIB is your unique business identification number, automatically issued when you register through the OSS (Online Single Submission) system. It serves as your basic business license and proof of legal business registration.",
      keyPoints: [
        "13-digit unique identifier",
        "Issued through OSS system",
        "Required for ALL business activities",
        "Replaces multiple old licenses"
      ],
      impact: "Without NIB, you cannot legally operate, open bank accounts, or apply for additional permits.",
      severity: "high"
    }

## What NIB Replaces

NIB consolidated several previously separate licenses:

| Old License | Function | Now Part of NIB |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **TDP** | Company registration | ✓ Replaced |
| **API-U** | General importer ID | ✓ Replaced |
| **Angka Pengenal Impor** | Import number | ✓ Replaced |
| **Access to customs** | Import clearance | ✓ Included |

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="One Number, Many Functions">
NIB simplifies business registration. Instead of obtaining multiple separate licenses, you get one NIB that serves multiple purposes. This was a major improvement from the pre-2018 system.

## NIB and Risk Classification

Under OSS RBA (Risk-Based Approach), your NIB determines what additional permits you need:

| Risk Level | NIB + What Else? |
|------------|------------------|
| **Low Risk** | NIB only |
| **Medium-Low** | NIB + Sertifikat Standar |
| **Medium-High** | NIB + Sertifikat Standar + Verification |
| **High Risk** | NIB + Full Izin (License) |

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Risk Determined by KBLI">
Your business activity codes (KBLI) determine the risk level. Tech consulting is usually low-medium risk. Food production is higher risk. The OSS system automatically classifies based on your KBLI selection.
