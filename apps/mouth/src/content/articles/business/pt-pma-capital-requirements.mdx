# PT PMA Capital Requirements: What You Need to Invest 2026

The **IDR 10 billion** (~$625,000 USD) minimum investment for PT PMA is one of the most misunderstood requirements. Let's break down what it actually means.

## The Two Key Numbers

| Requirement | Amount | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **Total Investment** | IDR 10 billion min | Total planned investment over company life |
| **Paid-up Capital** | IDR 10 billion min | Cash deposited in company bank account |

<InfoCard variant="important" title="Both Must Be Met">
As of current regulations, **both** the total investment plan AND the paid-up capital must be at least IDR 10 billion. This changed from previous rules where paid-up capital could be lower.
