# RPTKA & IMTA Explained: Indonesia's Work Authorization System 2026

When hiring a foreign worker in Indonesia, the employer must obtain authorization BEFORE the worker applies for their permit. This involves two key documents: RPTKA and the Notifikasi (formerly IMTA).

## What is RPTKA?

<GlossaryTerm
  term="RPTKA"
  definition="Rencana Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing (Foreign Worker Utilization Plan) - a mandatory plan that Indonesian companies must submit to justify hiring foreign workers."
/>

RPTKA is the employer's plan that explains:
- **Why** a foreign worker is needed
- **What** position they will fill
- **How long** they need the foreign worker
- **What** skills transfer will occur

### RPTKA Requirements

The company must demonstrate:

1. **Position cannot be filled locally** - No qualified Indonesian available
2. **Skills transfer plan** - How the foreigner will train local staff
3. **Indonesian companion** - Local staff assigned to learn from foreigner
4. **Time limit** - Plan to eventually replace with Indonesian

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="RPTKA Validity">
RPTKA approval is tied to specific:
- Company (cannot transfer between companies)
- Position (cannot change roles)
- Duration (maximum 5 years, usually 1-2)

Changes require new RPTKA application.

## What is Notifikasi (IMTA)?

After RPTKA approval, the employer applies for **Notifikasi** - the actual work permit notification for the specific foreign worker.

### Key Differences from Old IMTA

| Aspect | Old IMTA | New Notifikasi |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Format | Physical card | Electronic notification |
| Issuance | Separate process | Auto-generated from RPTKA |
| Extension | Manual renewal | Through TKA Online |
| Validity | Matched KITAS | Matched RPTKA |

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Notifikasi is Automatic">
Once RPTKA is approved and you submit the foreign worker's details, Notifikasi is generated automatically through TKA Online. No separate application needed.
</InfoCard>

---

## DKP-TKA (Compensation Fund)

Every employer hiring foreign workers must pay the **Dana Kompensasi Penggunaan TKA**:

### Fee Structure
- **Rate**: USD 100 per month
- **Calculation**: Monthly rate × duration of work permit
- **Example**: 12-month permit = USD 1,200

### Payment Rules
- Paid upfront when applying for RPTKA
- Non-refundable (even if worker leaves early)
- Must be renewed with each extension
- Government revenue for skills training

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="Budget Accordingly">
For a 2-year KITAS:
- DKP-TKA: USD 2,400 (24 months × $100)
- This is separate from KITAS and visa fees
</InfoCard>

---

## Position Restrictions (DKPTKA)

The **Daftar Jabatan yang Dilarang untuk TKA** lists positions closed to foreigners:

### Prohibited Positions Include:
- Human Resources/Personnel Manager
- Quality Assurance positions
- Health & Safety Officer
- Supply Chain positions
- Administrative roles
- Many supervisor positions

### How to Check
1. Consult Ministry of Manpower list
2. Use exact job title in RPTKA
3. Be prepared to justify if borderline

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Position Matching">
Your actual work must match the RPTKA position. Working in a different role than approved is a violation and can result in:
- Work permit cancellation
- Fines for employer
- Deportation for worker
</InfoCard>

---

## Extension Process

To extend RPTKA/Notifikasi:

1. **Apply 30 days before expiry** - Don't wait until last minute
2. **Same TKA Online system** - No paper applications
3. **Pay new DKP-TKA** - For extension period
4. **Justify continued need** - Why foreigner still required
5. **Show skills transfer progress** - What has been taught to local staff
