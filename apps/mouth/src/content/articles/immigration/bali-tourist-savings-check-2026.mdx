# Bali Wants to Check Tourists' Bank Accounts: What We Know

---

## THE 30-SECOND BRIEF

> **Should I worry?** Not yet

- **What:** Bali wants to verify tourists' bank accounts before entry
- **Who's affected:** All international tourists (theoretically)
- **When:** Announced for 2026, no confirmed date
- **Risk Level:** LOW for now — just an announcement, no regulations published

---

## THE FACTS

On **January 1st, 2026**, Bali Governor Wayan Koster announced:

> "One aspect of quality tourism is the amount of money in visitors' accounts over the last three months."

**What Koster said:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Verification | Bank accounts from last 3 months |
| Assessment | Planned length of stay |
| Review | Activities planned during visit |
| Timeline | From 2026 |

**What he DID NOT say:**

| Missing Detail | Implication |
|----------------|-------------|
| Minimum amount required | We don't know how much is needed |
| Which accounts count | Checking? Savings? Crypto? |
| How it's verified | At airport? Online beforehand? |
| Who's exempt | KITAS? KITAP? Diplomats? |
| Practical procedure | No mechanism defined |

---

## THE BALI ZERO TAKE

**What the headlines don't tell you:**

This announcement has a fundamental problem: **immigration is federal jurisdiction, not provincial**. Bali doesn't have legal authority to impose entry requirements.

Koster has a history of strong announcements that later get watered down:
- Foreign motorbike ban → still not implemented
- Tourist tax → implemented but with many exemptions
- Airbnb crackdown → partial enforcement only

**Our interpretation:**

Probability this gets implemented as announced: **15-25%**

Most likely scenario: becomes an **additional fee** instead of screening, or remains "under study" for years.

**Our advice:**

Don't change your travel plans. There's nothing to do until implementing regulations (Pergub) are published. This may never happen.

<InfoCard type="info" title="International Comparison">
  Financial verification exists elsewhere:
  - **Thailand:** THB 20,000 (~$600) — random checks on arrival
  - **Schengen:** €50-100/day — required for visa application
  - **UK:** £1,000+ — required for visa application

  The difference? They all check during visa application. Bali wants to check those entering visa-free. Much more complicated.

## NEXT STEPS

### For tourists (1-2 weeks):
1. No action required
2. Travel normally
3. The policy (if it ever comes) won't be active before late 2026

### For digital nomads (1-6 months):
1. Consider appropriate visas (B211A)
2. The right visa could exempt you from any checks
3. Monitor developments, but don't stress

### For expats with KITAS/KITAP:
1. Probably exempt (but not confirmed)
2. Your legal status already protects you
3. Focus on normal renewals

## RED FLAGS TO MONITOR

These signals would indicate they're serious:

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Publication of Pergub (provincial regulation) | It's official |
| Announcement from Kemenkumham (national immigration) | Has federal backing |
| Official airport training | They're implementing |
| IT systems tender | Infrastructure coming |

None of these have happened. We're still at the "Koster said" stage.

## REALISTIC TIMELINE

| Period | Likely Scenario |
|--------|-----------------|
| Q1 2026 | Public debate, tourism industry pushback |
| Q2-Q3 2026 | Possible draft regulation (maybe) |
| Q4 2026 | Decision point: go ahead or silence |
| 2027 | If confirmed, possible pilot |
