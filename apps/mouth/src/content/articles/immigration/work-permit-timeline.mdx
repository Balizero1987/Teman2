## Can You Speed It Up?

### What You CAN'T Rush
- RPTKA review (government sets pace)
- System processing times
- Biometrics scheduling

### What You CAN Optimize
- Document preparation (start early)
- Agent selection (experienced = faster)
- Company readiness (update NIB beforehand)
- Complete application (no missing items)

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="No Official Rush Service">
There's no official "express" work permit process. Anyone promising guaranteed fast-tracking should be viewed skeptically. Experienced agents are faster because they avoid mistakes, not because they have special access.
