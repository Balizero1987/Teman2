## Director KITAS Specifics

### Who is a Director?

In Indonesian companies:
- **Direktur Utama** (President Director)
- **Direktur** (Director)

Listed in company deed (Akta), appointed by shareholders.

### Director Requirements

| Requirement | Director |
|-------------|----------|
| Education | Flexible (degree helps but not always required) |
| Experience | Less strict (5-year rule often waived) |
| Position restriction | Directors exempt from many restrictions |
| RPTKA justification | Easier (running own company) |

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="Director Advantage">
As a Director of your own PT PMA, you have more flexibility:
- Position is inherently justifiable
- Experience requirements less strict
- You control the sponsor (your company)
- Can define your own job scope
</InfoCard>

### Director Responsibilities

Beyond KITAS, directors have legal obligations:
- Company legal liability
- Tax compliance (company and personal)
- Employment law compliance
- Corporate reporting

## Employee KITAS Specifics

### Employee Requirements

<ComparisonTable
  title="Employee Qualification Requirements"
  description="What you need to qualify"
  items={[
    {
      name: "Education",
      values: {
        "Requirement": "Bachelor's degree or higher",
        "Field": "Relevant to position",
        "Verification": "May need legalization"
      }
    },
    {
      name: "Experience",
      values: {
        "Requirement": "Minimum 5 years",
        "Field": "In the specific role",
        "Verification": "Reference letters"
      },
      highlight: true
    },
    {
      name: "Position",
      values: {
        "Requirement": "Not on restricted list",
        "Field": "Managerial/specialist",
        "Verification": "RPTKA approval"
      }
    }
  ]}
/>

### Position Restrictions for Employees

Employees face stricter position controls:
- Cannot be in HR/Personnel
- Cannot be in QC (quality control)
- Limited administrative roles
- Must be managerial/specialist level

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Position Must Match">
As an employee, your actual work must exactly match the approved RPTKA position. Directors have more flexibility in defining their role.
</InfoCard>

## Process Differences

### Director KITAS Process

1. Establish/join PT PMA as Director
2. Company deed shows your appointment
3. Company applies for RPTKA (for you)
4. Continue with normal KITAS process
5. You control the timeline (you're the boss)

### Employee KITAS Process

1. Get job offer from Indonesian company
2. Employer applies for RPTKA
3. You provide documents to employer
4. Employer manages the process
5. You depend on employer's timeline

## Cost Comparison

| Cost Item | Director | Employee |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| DKP-TKA | Yes (company pays) | Yes (company usually pays) |
| KITAS fees | Yes | Yes |
| Agent fees | Often bundled with company setup | Employer typically pays |
| Who bears cost | Your company | Employer |

**Net effect**: Similar total costs, but directors essentially pay from their own company, while employees have costs covered by employer.

---

## Changing Between Types

### Employee to Director
If you become a Director:
- May need new RPTKA (different position)
- Company deed must be updated
- Transition can be done at extension

### Director to Employee
If you leave your company for employment:
- Old KITAS invalid
- New employer must apply for new RPTKA
- Full process restart

<InfoCard variant="note" title="KITAS is Position-Specific">
Every significant role change requires new RPTKA. You can't simply "convert" director KITAS to employee or vice versa.
</InfoCard>
