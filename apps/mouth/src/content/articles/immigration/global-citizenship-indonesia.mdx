# Global Citizenship of Indonesia: The Long-Awaited Embrace

For decades, Indonesia told its children abroad: *choose*. Us or them. The red passport or the foreign one. No middle ground. Millions chose — often with heavy hearts — to build lives elsewhere, leaving behind not just a document, but a piece of who they were.

On **November 19, 2025**, something shifted.

<InfoCard variant="highlight" title="What is GCI?">
The government launched the **Global Citizenship of Indonesia (GCI)**: not dual citizenship (that remains constitutionally off-limits), but something remarkably close.

A **permanent residence permit with no expiration date**. No renewals. No sponsor needed. A late embrace, but a real one.
</InfoCard>

## What GCI Is NOT

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Important Limitations">
Let's be clear: **this is not citizenship**.

- **Cannot vote** in Indonesian elections
- **Cannot buy freehold land** (Hak Milik)
- **Cannot work as employee** for Indonesian companies
- No local salary, no employment contract

But you CAN:
- Live here permanently
- Invest and run foreign businesses remotely
- Manage your assets
- Retire by the rice fields
- Come and go without visa concerns
</InfoCard>

---

## The Work Restriction: Our Take

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Editorial Opinion">
The law is explicit — GCI holders **cannot receive wages from Indonesian entities**.

For retirees, investors, and remote workers, this changes nothing. But for diaspora professionals who dreamed of returning to work in Jakarta or Surabaya? It's a door still half-closed.

**Our honest view**: This restriction makes sense for now. Indonesia is testing the waters. The program is modeled after India's OCI, which also limits local employment.

If GCI proves successful and the diaspora demonstrates value without displacing local workers, we wouldn't be surprised to see this rule soften in future revisions. For now, plan accordingly.

## The Bigger Picture

There's a Javanese saying: *"Pisang tidak akan jatuh jauh dari pohonnya"* — the banana never falls far from its tree.

After decades of closed doors, Indonesia has finally built a path home for those who want to return to their roots. Not as tourists. **As family**.
