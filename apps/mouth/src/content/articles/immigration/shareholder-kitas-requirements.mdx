## Pure Investor (No Work)

If you're a passive shareholder:

### What You CAN Do
- Attend annual general meetings
- Participate in shareholder decisions
- Receive dividends
- Review company reports
- Visit your investment

### What You CANNOT Do
- Manage daily operations
- Direct employees
- Sign contracts as company rep
- Represent company to clients
- Make operational decisions

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Line Between Active and Passive">
Immigration can question if you're "really" just an investor if you're constantly at the office. Keep your activities clearly passive if using Investor KITAS.
</InfoCard>
