- No need to apply each trip
- Most convenient for business travelers

Most KITAS holders get MERP from the start.
</InfoCard>

### MERP Details

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Validity | Same as KITAS validity |
| Trips allowed | Unlimited |
| Application | Usually with KITAS processing |
| Cost | IDR 1-1.5M typically |
| Processing | 3-5 working days |

## SERP (Single Exit Re-Entry Permit)

### When to Use

| Use Case | SERP Makes Sense |
|----------|------------------|
| One planned trip | Short KITAS validity |
| Budget conscious | Saves money vs MERP |
| Rare travel | Don't travel often |

### SERP Limitations

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="One Trip Only">
**SERP allows only ONE exit and re-entry:**

- Used up after one trip
- Must apply again for next trip
- Less convenient than MERP
- Consider MERP if you might travel more

If you're likely to travel multiple times, MERP is better value.
</InfoCard>

### What is EPO?

| Purpose | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Final departure | Leaving Indonesia permanently |
| KITAS cancelation | Usually accompanies cancelation |
| No return | Cannot re-enter on same KITAS |

### When EPO Required

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Permanent Exit">
**EPO is needed when:**

- Ending employment in Indonesia
- Not renewing KITAS
- Changing to different visa type
- Leaving Indonesia permanently

EPO effectively cancels your KITAS.
</InfoCard>

|------|--------|
| 1 | Submit KITAS for cancelation |
| 2 | Apply for EPO |
