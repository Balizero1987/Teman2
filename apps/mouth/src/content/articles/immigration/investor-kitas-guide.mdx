# Investor KITAS Guide: Living in Indonesia as an Investor 2025

If you're investing in an Indonesian company, you may qualify for an Investor KITAS (C313) - allowing you to live in Indonesia based on your investment, not employment.

## What is Investor KITAS?

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Investor KITAS (C313)">
A Limited Stay Permit for foreign investors who:
- Own shares in an Indonesian company (PT PMA)
- Meet minimum investment requirements
- May or may not work in the company

**Key benefit**: You don't need RPTKA (work authorization) if you're purely an investor not working in the company.
</InfoCard>

2. **Longer validity** - Often 2 years
3. **Path to KITAP** - Permanent residency after 3 consecutive years
