## The Honest Assessment

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="What They Don't Tell You">
**The $350K is just the beginning.**

Real costs often include:
- **Property purchase fees**: 5-10% on top of purchase price
- **Legal and notary fees**: IDR 50-100 million
- **Annual property taxes**: 0.5% of NJOP value
- **Visa processing fees**: IDR 10-20 million
- **Agent/consultant fees**: IDR 30-100 million

Total first-year cost can reach **$380,000-$420,000** depending on your setup.
</InfoCard>

## Who Should Consider This?

The Golden Visa makes sense if you:

1. **Already planned to invest** in Indonesian property or business
2. **Need long-term stability** without annual renewals
3. **Want work authorization** (comes with KITAS conversion)
4. **Value family inclusion** in one package
5. **Plan to spend significant time** in Indonesia

---

## Who Should Look Elsewhere?

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Better Alternatives May Exist">
Consider other options if:

- **Budget is tight**: Second Home Visa requires only $130K proof of funds (not investment)
- **You're 55+**: Retirement KITAS is simpler and cheaper
- **No work needed**: VOA with extensions or D12 Business visa may suffice
- **Indonesian heritage**: New GCI program offers permanent residence

The Golden Visa is premium-priced for premium flexibility. If you don't need all features, don't pay for them.

## The Bottom Line

<InfoCard variant="success" title="One Year Verdict">
The Golden Visa delivers what it promises: **long-term stability and work rights for serious investors**.

Is it worth $350K+? That depends entirely on your situation:
- If you were investing anyway, **yes**.
- If you're buying a visa, **probably not** — cheaper options exist.

The program is legitimate, processing is improving, and approvals are happening. But go in with realistic expectations about costs and timelines.
