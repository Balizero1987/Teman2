# Gemini 2.0 Ultra: When AI Sees Everything

Google has been the "almost there" player in AI for years. With **Gemini 2.0 Ultra**, they're no longer chasing — they're leading in multimodal capability.

## The Multimodal Advantage

<InfoCard variant="highlight" title="What Gemini 2.0 Can Process">
All of these, simultaneously, in a single prompt:

- **Video** — Up to 2 hours of footage
- **Audio** — Music, speech, ambient sound
- **Images** — Photos, diagrams, charts
- **Documents** — PDFs, spreadsheets, code
- **3D Models** — Architectural plans, CAD files
</InfoCard>

This isn't "process one type at a time." It's genuine multimodal reasoning — understanding a construction video while referencing the blueprint while calculating material costs.
