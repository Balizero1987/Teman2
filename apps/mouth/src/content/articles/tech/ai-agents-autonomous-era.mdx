# AI Agents: From Chatbots to Coworkers

The AI you've been using is reactive — it waits for prompts and responds. **AI Agents** are proactive — they take goals and execute multi-step plans autonomously.

This is the most significant shift since mobile computing.

## What AI Agents Can Do Today

## The Agent Architecture

Modern AI agents work through a loop:

```
1. PERCEIVE → Gather information from tools/APIs
2. PLAN → Break goal into steps
3. ACT → Execute step using tools
4. REFLECT → Evaluate results
5. REPEAT → Until goal achieved
```

This is fundamentally different from prompt-response. The agent maintains state, learns from failures, and adapts strategy mid-execution.
