# Claude 4.5 Opus: The AI That Actually Thinks

On October 22, 2024, Anthropic quietly released what many are now calling the most significant AI breakthrough since GPT-4. **Claude 4.5 Opus** doesn't just respond — it *reasons*, *reflects*, and *reconsiders*.

---

## What Makes Opus Different

<InfoCard variant="highlight" title="Extended Thinking">
For the first time, an AI model can spend **minutes** thinking through complex problems before responding. This isn't just longer processing — it's genuine deliberation visible in real-time.
</InfoCard>

The technical leap is staggering:

- **200K context window** (expandable to 1M for enterprise)
- **Multi-step reasoning chains** that self-correct
- **Uncertainty acknowledgment** — it tells you when it doesn't know
- **Constitutional AI 2.0** — safety without lobotomization

## Real-World Performance

| Benchmark | Claude 4.5 Opus | GPT-4o | Gemini 1.5 Pro |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| MMLU | 93.7% | 88.7% | 90.1% |
| HumanEval | 92.4% | 86.6% | 84.1% |
| Legal Reasoning | 97.2% | 89.3% | 88.7% |
| Math (MATH) | 94.1% | 84.2% | 86.2% |

The legal reasoning benchmark is particularly relevant for businesses operating in complex regulatory environments like Indonesia.

---

## Why This Matters for Business

For companies navigating Indonesian regulations, Claude 4.5 Opus offers something unprecedented:

1. **Document Analysis** — Process contracts, permits, and regulations with near-human comprehension
2. **Multi-language Support** — Seamless Indonesian-English reasoning
3. **Compliance Checking** — Identify regulatory gaps in real-time
4. **Strategic Planning** — Extended thinking for complex business decisions

---

## The Extended Thinking Feature

<InfoCard variant="info" title="How It Works">
When faced with a complex query, Opus can enter "thinking mode" — visibly working through the problem step by step. You can watch the reasoning unfold, making AI decision-making transparent for the first time.
</InfoCard>

This isn't marketing speak. In our testing for immigration and business consulting queries, Opus consistently:

- Identified edge cases humans missed
- Cross-referenced multiple regulatory sources
- Flagged potential conflicts between rules
- Suggested alternative approaches when blocked

---

## Pricing Reality

| Tier | Input (1M tokens) | Output (1M tokens) |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Standard | $15 | $75 |
| Extended Thinking | $15 | $75 (+ thinking tokens) |
| Batch | $7.50 | $37.50 |

For businesses: the ROI on complex analysis tasks is immediate. A single contract review that previously took hours of consultant time can be completed in minutes.

---

## What's Next

Anthropic is already hinting at:

- **Claude 5** (codename: "Opus Pro") — expected Q3 2026
- **Enterprise Memory** — persistent context across sessions
- **Tool Integration 2.0** — native API execution

---

## The Bottom Line

Claude 4.5 Opus isn't just an upgrade. It's the first AI that genuinely seems to *understand* rather than just predict. For businesses operating in regulatory-complex markets like Indonesia, this changes the game entirely.
