# AI Regulation: The Global Landscape

2026 marks the year AI regulation became serious. The EU AI Act is fully enforceable. US Executive Orders shape industry practices. And Asia is finding its own path.

For businesses operating internationally, understanding this landscape isn't optional.

## The EU AI Act

<InfoCard variant="highlight" title="Key Requirements (In Effect)">

**Risk-Based Classification:**
- **Unacceptable**: Banned (social scoring, subliminal manipulation)
- **High-Risk**: Heavy regulation (hiring, credit, healthcare)
- **Limited Risk**: Transparency required (chatbots, deepfakes)
- **Minimal Risk**: Largely unregulated (spam filters, games)

**Penalties:**
- Up to €35M or 7% global revenue
- Graduated enforcement through 2027

</InfoCard>

## What This Means for Business

| AI Use Case | Risk Level | Requirements |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Hiring screening | High | Impact assessment, human oversight, logging |
| Customer chatbot | Limited | Disclose AI nature |
| Document summary | Minimal | None specific |
| Credit scoring | High | Explainability, appeal rights |
| Marketing personalization | Limited | Transparency about profiling |

## United States Approach

The US takes a sectoral rather than comprehensive approach:

<InfoCard variant="info" title="US AI Governance">

**Executive Order 14110 (Active):**
- Reporting requirements for large models
- Safety testing mandates
- Federal procurement standards

**Sector-Specific:**
- FDA: AI medical devices
- FTC: AI consumer protection
- SEC: AI in financial services
- DOL: AI in employment

**State Level:**
- California AI Safety Bill (debated)
- Various state-specific rules

## China's Regulatory Framework

China has moved faster than anyone on AI regulation:

| Regulation | Focus | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Algorithm Recommendations | Social media, e-commerce | Enforced |
| Deep Synthesis (Deepfakes) | Identity verification | Enforced |
| Generative AI Rules | Model registration, content | Enforced |
| Draft AI Law | Comprehensive framework | Pending |
