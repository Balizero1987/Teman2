# Freelancing Legally in Indonesia 2026: Complete Guide

Many digital nomads freelance while in Indonesia. Here's how to understand the legal landscape and stay compliant.

## The Freelancing Question

## Tax Implications

### Tax Residency

<Calculator
  title="Tax Residency Calculator"
  description="Check if you're an Indonesian tax resident"
  fields={[
    {
      id: "days",
      label: "Days in Indonesia This Year",
      type: "number",
      defaultValue: 120,
      min: 0,
      max: 365,
      suffix: "days"
    },
    {
      id: "intention",
      label: "Plan to Stay Long-term?",
      type: "select",
      options: [
        { value: "no", label: "No, temporary only" },
        { value: "maybe", label: "Maybe, unsure" },
        { value: "yes", label: "Yes, planning to stay" }
      ],
      defaultValue: "maybe"
    }
  ]}
  calculateResult={(values) => {
    const days = Number(values.days);
    const intention = values.intention;

    let status = "Non-resident";
    let risk = "Low";

    if (days >= 183) {
      status = "Likely Tax Resident";
      risk = "High";
    } else if (days >= 120 && intention === "yes") {
      status = "Possible Tax Resident";
      risk = "Medium";
    } else if (days >= 90 && intention === "yes") {
      status = "Possible Tax Resident";
      risk = "Low-Medium";
    }

    return {
      total: days,
      breakdown: [
        { label: "Days in Indonesia", amount: days },
        { label: "Threshold for Tax Residency", amount: 183 }
      ],
      currency: "days",
      note: `Status: ${status} | Risk Level: ${risk}`
    };
  }}
/>

### Tax Rates for Residents

| Income (IDR) | Tax Rate |
|--------------|----------|
| 0 - 60M | 5% |
| 60M - 250M | 15% |
| 250M - 500M | 25% |
| 500M - 5B | 30% |
| Over 5B | 35% |

## PT PMA for Freelancers

### When You Need PT PMA

- Working with Indonesian clients
- Wanting full legality
- Building long-term presence
- Needing Indonesian contracts

### PT PMA Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Setup | IDR 50-100M |
| Capital requirement | IDR 10B (committed) |
| Annual maintenance | IDR 30-50M |
| Work permit (KITAS) | IDR 20-30M |

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Is PT PMA Worth It?">
For most freelancers working only with foreign clients, PT PMA is overkill.

**Consider PT PMA if:**
- Indonesian clients want to pay you
- Revenue justifies the cost (IDR 100M+/year)
- You want full legal peace of mind
- You're building a business, not just freelancing
</InfoCard>

## Practical Approaches

### Approach 1: Pure Remote

<Checklist
  title="Remote-Only Strategy"
  description="For foreign-client freelancers"
  persistKey="remote-freelance-checklist"
  items={[
    {
      id: "visa",
      label: "Appropriate visa (E33G Digital Nomad)",
      description: "Not tourist visa for extended stays",
      required: true,
      category: "legal"
    },
    {
      id: "foreign-bank",
      label: "Foreign bank account",
      description: "Receive payments outside Indonesia",
      required: true,
      category: "financial"
    },
    {
      id: "foreign-clients",
      label: "Foreign clients only",
      description: "No Indonesian invoices",
      required: true,
      category: "work"
    },
    {
      id: "home-tax",
      label: "Pay taxes in home country",
      description: "Maintain tax obligations",
      required: true,
      category: "tax"
    },
    {
      id: "days-track",
      label: "Track days in Indonesia",
      description: "Stay aware of 183-day threshold",
      required: true,
      category: "tax"
    }
  ]}
  categories={[
    { id: "legal", label: "Legal", color: "blue" },
    { id: "financial", label: "Financial", color: "green" },
    { id: "work", label: "Work", color: "amber" },
    { id: "tax", label: "Tax", color: "red" }
  ]}
  showProgress={true}
/>

### Approach 2: Proper Indonesian Setup

For those wanting full legality:

1. **Establish PT PMA** (~3-6 months)
2. **Get Director KITAS** (through your company)
3. **Register for taxes** (NPWP, PKP if needed)
4. **Invoice properly** (Indonesian tax invoices)
5. **Pay Indonesian taxes** (corporate and personal)

---

## Foreign Company Option

Some freelancers use a foreign company:

### Benefits
- Invoice clients professionally
- Separate business from personal
- Tax planning opportunities
- No Indonesian setup needed

### Popular Jurisdictions
- Singapore (expensive but close)
- Hong Kong (business-friendly)
- USA LLC (for US residents)
- Estonia e-Residency (EU access)

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="Singapore vs Others">
Singapore is popular for Indonesia-based freelancers:
- Close time zone
- Business-friendly
- Good banking
- Professional image

But annual costs are $2-5K+.
</InfoCard>

---

## Insurance & Contracts

### Without PT PMA

- Difficult to enforce Indonesian contracts
- Limited legal protection
- Insurance may have limitations

### Recommended Coverage

| Insurance | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Health insurance | Medical coverage |
| Professional liability | Client disputes |
| Equipment | Laptop, gear protection |

---

## Banking Solutions

### For Remote Freelancers

| Solution | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Wise | Multi-currency, cheap transfers | Not a full bank |
| Revolut | Good for spending | Limited in Indonesia |
| Home country bank | Stable, familiar | Transfer fees |
| Indonesian bank | Local payments | Needs KITAS |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Working on tourist visa long-term** - Get proper visa
2. **Invoicing Indonesian companies** - Needs PT PMA
3. **Ignoring tax residency** - Track your days
4. **No contracts** - Always have agreements
5. **Not tracking income** - Keep records
6. **Mixing personal/business** - Separate accounts
7. **Assuming no one cares** - Rules can change

---

## When to Get Professional Help

Consider consulting a professional if:
- Indonesian clients want to hire you
- You're staying 183+ days
- You want full legal compliance
- You're earning significant income
- You're building a business
