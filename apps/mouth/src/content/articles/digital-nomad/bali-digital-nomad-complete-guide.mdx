# Bali for Digital Nomads: The Complete 2025 Guide

Bali isn't just a tropical paradise—it's become one of the world's most popular destinations for remote workers. The combination of affordable living, strong internet, established coworking infrastructure, and an international community makes it a compelling base for digital nomads.

But working remotely from Bali isn't as simple as booking a flight and opening your laptop. There are visa considerations, legal gray areas, practical challenges, and lifestyle factors to navigate.

This guide covers everything you need to know to make Bali work as your remote work base.

## The Legal Reality: Can You Actually Work From Bali?

Let's address the elephant in the room first.

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="The Gray Area">
**Technically**, working on a tourist visa in Indonesia is illegal. The law requires a work permit (IMTA) for any work performed in Indonesia, regardless of who your employer is.

**In practice**, Indonesia has not historically enforced this against remote workers serving clients outside Indonesia. Thousands of digital nomads work from Bali on tourist visas without issue.

**But**: This is a gray area, not a legal pathway. The risk is real, even if enforcement is rare. This guide presents the facts; you make your own risk assessment.

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Beyond Coworking">
Many digital nomads work from:
- **Cafes**: Canggu and Ubud have excellent work cafes (Zin Cafe, Sensorium, Milk & Madu)
- **Home/villa**: With good internet, many work from their accommodation
- **Beach clubs**: Some have WiFi (La Brisa, The Lawn) for casual work

Coworking makes sense for: reliable internet, community, meeting rooms, and work-life separation.

## Internet Reality

<InfoCard variant="important" title="Internet Is Good (Usually)">
Bali's internet has improved dramatically. In popular areas, you can expect:
- **Fiber connections**: 50-200 Mbps available in most developed areas
- **4G/LTE**: Good coverage, useful as backup
- **Coworking**: Generally 100+ Mbps, redundant connections

But it's not perfect:
- Outages happen (rain, infrastructure issues)
- Some areas still have poor coverage
- Always have a backup (phone hotspot)
</InfoCard>

### Internet Options

| Option | Speed | Cost/Month | Reliability | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Fiber (Biznet, MyRepublic)** | 50-200 Mbps | IDR 400-900k | Good | Requires address, 1yr contract |
| **IndiHome** | 20-100 Mbps | IDR 300-600k | Variable | Government provider, widespread |
| **4G Hotspot** | 10-50 Mbps | IDR 100-300k | Good | Telkomsel/XL, good backup |
| **Coworking** | 100+ Mbps | Included | Excellent | Most reliable option |
| **Starlink** | 50-150 Mbps | ~$120/mo | Excellent | New option, needs registration |

### Internet Tips

1. **Test before committing** to long-term accommodation
2. **Have mobile backup** (Telkomsel has best coverage)
3. **Use VPN** for accessing blocked sites
4. **Coworking** for important calls/deadlines
5. **Starlink** if you're in a remote area

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<InfoCard variant="error" title="Don't Do This">
**1. Underestimating visa complexity**
Don't assume you can just "figure it out" on arrival. Have a visa plan.

**2. Over-optimizing for timezone**
Working US nights will destroy you eventually. Prioritize sustainable setup.

**3. Staying in the bubble**
Bali is more than Canggu. Explore. Meet locals. Learn some Indonesian.

**4. No backup internet**
When WiFi dies before an important call, you need a plan.

**5. Ignoring health insurance**
One hospital visit can wipe out months of "savings."

**6. Visa runs as long-term strategy**
It works until it doesn't. Build toward something stable.

**7. All work, no play**
You came to Bali. Experience it. The laptop will wait.
