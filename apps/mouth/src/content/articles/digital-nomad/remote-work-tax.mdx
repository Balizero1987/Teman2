# Remote Work Tax Indonesia 2025: Digital Nomad Tax Guide

Remote workers and digital nomads face unique tax questions. Here's how taxation works when you're location-independent in Indonesia.

## The Key Question

<DecisionTree
  title="Are You Tax Resident?"
  description="Determine your status"
  nodes={[
    {
      id: "start",
      question: "How long in Indonesia this year?",
      options: [
        { label: "Less than 183 days", next: "nonresident" },
        { label: "183 days or more", next: "resident-check" }
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "resident-check",
      question: "Do you intend to stay in Indonesia?",
      options: [
        { label: "Yes, I live here", next: "resident" },
        { label: "Just extended stay", next: "complex" }
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "nonresident",
      result: {
        title: "Non-Resident Status",
        description: "Under 183 days generally means no Indonesian tax residency. Your tax obligations depend on your home country's rules and where your income is sourced."
      }
    },
    {
      id: "resident",
      result: {
        title: "Tax Resident",
        description: "Over 183 days with intent to stay means Indonesian tax residency. You're subject to tax on worldwide income. Need NPWP and annual tax filing."
      }
    },
    {
      id: "complex",
      result: {
        title: "Situation Depends",
        description: "Gray area requiring analysis. Factors include: intent, ties to Indonesia, visa type, where you're paid. Consider professional tax advice."
      }
    }
  ]}

## Tax Residency Explained

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="The 183-Day Rule">
**Indonesian tax residency triggers:**

1. Present in Indonesia **183+ days** in 12 months, OR
2. Residing in Indonesia with **intention to stay**

**If tax resident:**
- Taxed on worldwide income
- Must have NPWP
- Must file annual tax return

This applies regardless of visa type!
</InfoCard>

## Working on Tourist Visa

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="The Gray Area">
**Technically:**
- Tourist visa = no work permitted
- Working remotely for foreign clients = gray area
- Indonesia hasn't actively enforced on remote workers
- But rules could be enforced

**The reality:**
- Many digital nomads work on tourist visas
- Not technically legal if "working"
- Low enforcement currently
- Risk is yours to assess

For full compliance, consider B211A or Remote Worker Visa.

## Home Country Tax

### Don't Forget Home

<InfoCard variant="note" title="Double Tax Risk">
**You may still owe tax at home:**

- US citizens: Taxed on worldwide income regardless
- Most countries: Tax residents pay home tax
- Treaties: May reduce but not eliminate
- Reporting: May need to report foreign income

**Check with your home country!**
- Tax residency rules there
- Foreign income reporting
- Tax treaty benefits
- Foreign tax credits
</InfoCard>

### Common Home Countries

| Country | If You Leave |
|---------|--------------|
| USA | Still taxed as citizen |
| UK | May remain tax resident |
| Australia | 183-day test applies |
| Canada | Depends on ties |
| Netherlands | Must formally exit |
| Germany | Depends on ties |

---

## Tax Treaties

### How Treaties Help

Indonesia has tax treaties with many countries that:
- Prevent double taxation
- Determine which country taxes what
- Allow foreign tax credits
- May reduce rates

### Key Treaty Benefits

| Income Type | Treaty Benefit |
|-------------|----------------|
| Employment | Usually taxed where performed |
| Self-employment | Depends on PE |
| Dividends | Reduced rates |
| Interest | Reduced rates |
| Royalties | Reduced rates |

---

## Structuring Options

### For Compliant Remote Work

| Option | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| PT PMA | Indonesian company, you as director |
| Foreign company | Remain employed by foreign entity |
| Freelance with NPWP | Self-employed in Indonesia |
| Stay non-resident | Under 183 days |

<InfoCard variant="tip" title="For Longer Stays">
**If staying long-term:**

Consider **PT PMA** structure:
- Legal work authorization
- Clear tax position
- Can invoice clients
- Bank account access
- Professional status

Yes, there's cost and complexity, but it provides clarity.
</InfoCard>

## Practical Compliance

### If You Become Tax Resident

| Step | When |
|------|------|
| Get NPWP | When resident, before March filing |
| Track all income | Throughout year |
| Calculate tax | By year end |
| File SPT | By March 31 |
| Pay any balance | By March 31 |

### Documentation to Keep

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Days in Indonesia | Prove residency status |
| Income records | All sources |
| Foreign tax paid | For credits |
| Bank statements | Support income claims |
| Contracts | Evidence of arrangement |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Risk |
|---------|------|
| Ignoring 183-day rule | Unexpected tax liability |
| Assuming tourist visa = no tax | Not how tax residency works |
| Not reporting foreign income | Tax evasion |
| Double taxation | Not using treaties |
| No documentation | Audit problems |
