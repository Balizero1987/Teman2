Coretax Activation Guide: 4 Things Taxpayers Must Know

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The number of taxpayers activating Coretax accounts continues to rise. The Directorate General of Taxes (DJP) at the Finance Ministry reported that as of December 30, 2025, there were 10.22 million active accounts. This figure is an increase from 9.87 million on the previous day.
DJP Director of Education, Services, and Public Relations, Rosmauli, stated that out of the 10.22 million accounts, 9,332,720 belong to individuals. Additionally, there are 805,607 corporate taxpayers, 88,208 government agencies, and 221 Trading Through Electronic Systems (PMSE) entities.
Rosmauli highlighted four points for taxpayers to consider as visits to tax offices increase for account activation and the issuance of Authorization Codes or Electronic Certificates (KO/SE). The following are the four directives from the DJP regarding the procedures and deadlines for these processes.
First, taxpayers can activate accounts and obtain KO/SE before they start using Coretax services. This means the deadline for activation does not end on December 31. Taxpayers have flexibility in when they choose to set up their access to the new system.
However, the DJP recommends completing the activation as soon as possible. Doing so helps avoid a surge in requests during the Annual Tax Return (SPT) reporting period. The deadline for individuals to submit their SPT is March 31, while corporate taxpayers have until April 30. Early activation prevents delays during these peak months.
Second, taxpayers can activate their Coretax accounts and issue KO/SE independently. They can follow official tutorials available on the website https://pajak.go.id or the DJP social media account (@DitjenPajakRI). A specific link for activation is also available at https://t.kemenkeu.go.id/akuncoretax.
Third, the DJP advises those facing technical issues or data changes to manage their visits to the tax office wisely. Planning the visit helps ensure smooth service and helps the office manage queues effectively. This is particularly important for those who require direct assistance from tax officers.
Fourth, all services at the tax office are free of charge. The DJP urges the public not to use intermediaries or brokers. Taxpayers should remain alert to fraud from individuals claiming to be tax officers or those promising faster service in exchange for rewards.
