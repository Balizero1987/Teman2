Bali Indo Wellness, Yoga & Meditation Journey
Overview
Bali Bliss & Wellness Retreat
With Nyepi Day of Silence
Swan Michelle
March 12-21, 2026
Of all of my world travels, Bali Indo is one of my favorite places on the planet as it is rich in devotional practices at every step, prayer, vibrant colors, fresh foods, tropical atmospheres, gorgeous temples, dharmic living, safety, epic diversity of nature, yogic and meditation tradition and more, all on 1 island.
I have taken groups to Bali for 5 straight years, and can’t wait to bring you for the trip of a lifetime.
The pictures say it all. Please reach out if you have questions. I have Balinese friends, and so this trip is always very smooth as we are hooked up generously. It is earful, complication free, and we will tap right into the humble, devotional culture.

Traveling To Bali:
I suggest you buy a plane ticket that departs March 10 evening as to get to Bali by Noon on March 12
Plane tickets are cheaper around Thanksgiving. It is a great time to purchase a ticket.
Note there are a few airports in Bali. Choose Denpasar.
.
Once you get your flight information, please forward it to me so that I can advise our host, Agus Jack, our Balinese local and epic host.
A current up to date Passport is required.Check that your passport is more than 3 months current and up to date.
A Visa is required, and can easily be attainted upon arrival at customs.
Arrival date, when buying an airline ticket, needs to be ARRIVING Feburary 8th. You will be picked up no matter what time you arrive.
Keep in mind that from the East coast, it takes 23 hours to arrive in Bali Indo. This means you will probably be leaving Febuary 7th to arrive on the 8th.
Arrival airport: Denpasar, Ngurah Rai International Airport
UPON ARRIVAL:
To make phone calls, make sure you have an international phone plan.
Get some cash right away at the airport currency exchange. Villages accept only cash/local currency.
Contact your banks to let them know you are traveling internatioanlly. Larger hotels, resaturants and stores accept CC but your bank needs to know you are traveling.
Know your PIN number for ATM machines. There are ATM's in Ubud but choose your ATM wisely. Use onlly well known banks.
There is no need to exchange any money prior to arriving in Bali. This can be done right after you arrive.

This is a tropical climate. Bring summer attire. The Balinese are also modest. bring some modest attire for the temples that will cover your legs.
It may rain. Bring a light rain jacket.
Walking shoes/sandals
Yoga travel mat
Sunscreen ( it is expensive there!)
There are also really cool shops everywhere. I would pack light with a pretty empty suitecase.
