Heart & Willpower Awakening Yoga Retreat
Overview
A Transformational Yoga Retreat for Inner Strength, Authentic Love & Purpose
February 14–21 2026 | Bali | With Peter & Gabriela | In English
There are moments in life when you feel the quiet call to rise - to open your heart more fully, to strengthen your inner resolve, and to step into the person you know you can be. If you feel that calling, this retreat is your invitation.
In the nourishing, peaceful embrace of Bali, you will explore the two qualities that shape every meaningful change: an open heart that allows you to feel, connect, and love deeply… and a strong willpower that gives you direction, courage, and the ability to turn intentions into reality.
These two forces, when awakened together, create transformation that can uplift your personal life, relationships, work, and inner world.
Why Heart & Willpower Matter
A closed heart keeps us guarded, disconnected, and afraid to show our true selves. A weakened willpower leads to procrastination, emotional exhaustion, and feeling stuck.
When both are awakened:
- you trust your feelings
- you act with clarity
- you set boundaries with compassion
- you stay committed to your path
- you feel deeply alive, open, and purposeful
This retreat is designed to help you step into that state - gently, joyfully, authentically.
The Yogic Path to Transformation
Ancient yogic techniques have always emphasized that true change begins within. During this retreat, you will work with the practices traditionally used to awaken both love and inner strength:
🧘♂️ Asana practice
Heart-opening postures and grounding, strengthening sequences to unite courage with softness.
🌬 Breathwork (Pranayama)
Techniques that energize the inner fire, clear emotional heaviness, and expand your capacity to feel.
🔥 Kriya Yoga
Powerful practices that purify the energetic channels, release old blockages, and awaken vibrant willpower.
🎯 Concentration & Meditation
Learn to steady the mind, see yourself clearly, and act from intention rather than impulse.
Together, these practices help you cultivate the emotional openness and inner stability needed to transform your life from the inside out.
