Writers Retreat Bali 2026 'Shut Up and Write'
Overview
Always wanted to write, but haven't? What if things could be different?
Regardless of where you are in your writing journey, come away from the bustling crowds and join us for a Shut Up and Write retreat in one of the world’s most beautiful tranquil locations.
Our aim is to slow you down in order to release the real you. We create a space away from all cares of the everyday in a location deliberately removed from mundane. Relaxed. Restored. Reconnected. For you to uncover your creative potential.
It’s no secret writers struggle with focus. There are just too many interesting distractions at the end of our fingertips. How about ... instead ... you:
- Enhance your writing skills by investing your time in intentional self-reflection.
- Commit to engagement with the creative writing process.
- Come home with a plethora of tools and discovery of the best storytelling 'you'.
Breakthrough ...
Your retreat includes two days of ‘Creative Breakthrough and Release’, a practical hands-on seminar (valued at $2,200 on the mainland) that includes interactive Shut Up and Write workshop sessions where you discover freedom from the hindrances that block you and explore your own language of creativity.
If you are stuck somewhere between the multitude of words in your head and the blank page in front of you, this seminar will release you. We understand the creative struggle. We teach you tools of self-discovery to conquer that enemy called 'procrastination'.
Learn ...
Inspire. Create. Construct. Develop your ideas and concepts.
Draft. Revise. Share. Critique your drafts with other writers.
Reject. Select. Protect. Focus on honing your writing skills.
You'll also have days to write freely, enjoy the Bali sun-soak-sea experience, and visit tourist favourites (such as Tanah Lot, Ubud, Kuta beach, Legian markets, Seminyak Eat-street).
Your retreat experience will birth renewed trust in intuition and spontaneity, and release confidence in your writing.
