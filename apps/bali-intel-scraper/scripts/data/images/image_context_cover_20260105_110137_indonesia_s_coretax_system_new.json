The Directorate General of Taxes (DJP) at the Finance Ministry reported that as of December 30, 2025, there were 10.22 million active accounts. This figure is an increase from 9.87 million on the previous day.\nDJP Director of Education, Services, and Public Relations, Rosmauli, stated that out of the 10.22 million accounts, 9,332,720 belong to individuals. Additionally, there are 805,607 corporate taxpayers, 88,208 government agencies, and 221 Trading Through Electronic Systems (PMSE) entities.\nRosmauli highlighted four points for taxpayers to consider as visits to tax offices increase for account activation and the issuance of Authorization Codes or Electronic Certificates (KO/SE). The following are the four directives from the DJP regarding the procedures and deadlines for these processes.\nFirst, taxpayers can activate accounts and obtain KO/SE before they start using Coretax services. This means the deadline for activation does not end on December 31. Taxpayers have flexibility in when they choose to set up their access to the new system.\nHowever, the DJP recommends completing the activation as soon as possible. Doing so helps avoid a surge in requests during the Annual Tax Return (SPT) reporting period. The deadline for individuals to submit their SPT is March 31, while corporate taxpayers have until April 30. Early activation prevents delays during these peak months.\nSecond, taxpayers can activate their Coretax accounts and issue KO/SE independently. They can follow official tutorials available on the website https://pajak.go.id or the DJP social media account (@DitjenPajakRI). A specific link for activation is also available at https://t.kemenkeu.go.id/akuncoretax.\nThird, the DJP advises those facing technical issues or data changes to manage their visits to the tax office wisely"

CENTRAL THEME\n       - What is the ONE thing this article is about?\n       - Is it a PROBLEM, a SOLUTION, or INFORMATION?\n       - What would a headline writer summarize this as?\n\n    2. EMOTIONAL CORE\n       - How should the reader FEEL looking at this image?\n       - Frustrated? Relieved? Curious? Warned? Inspired?\n       - What's the emotional journey of the article?\n\n    3. THE MOMENT\n       - Is there a SPECIFIC moment in the article that captures everything?\n       - A scene described? A situation mentioned? A workaround suggested?\n       - What would a photojournalist shoot if they were covering this story?\n\n    4. UNIVERSAL vs SPECIFIC\n       - Is this a universal experience (anyone can relate)?\n       - Or Indonesia-specific (needs local context)?\n       - Balance: Bali setting visible but topic clear to anyone\n\n    5. THE 2-SECOND TEST\n       - If someone sees ONLY the image, will they understand the topic?\n       - No cryptic metaphors. No \"only Nostradamus understands\" imagery.\n       - Clear. Beautiful. But CLEAR first.\n    \n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nCATEGORY GUIDELINES (TAX):\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nTypical themes: system problems, new regulations, filing deadlines, NPWP issues, compliance\nEmotional range: confusion → understanding, frustration → resolution, worry → compliance\nSetting options: laptop with tax portal, tax office (KPP), consultation with expert, home office filing, error screens\nFORBIDDEN: money piles, coins, calculators alone, abstract metaphors, stressed cartoon faces\nREMEMBER: Tax articles often describe PROBLEMS with systems. Show the REALITY of dealing with it - the reload button, the office visit, the consultant help. Not abstract 'balance' metaphors.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nSTYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n\n    ALWAYS APPLY:\n    - Ultra-realistic photography (magazine quality, not AI-looking)\n    - Bali/Indonesia setting visible but not overwhelming\n    - Warm, natural lighting (Bali's golden hour aesthetic)\n    - 16:9 landscape format\n    - 8K detail, sharp focus on subject\n    - Space in upper area for potential text overlay\n    - No text, watermarks, or logos in image\n    - Real people in realistic situations (if people included)\n    - Cinematic composition (rule of thirds, leading lines)\n    \n\n\n    NEVER INCLUDE (regardless of category):\n    - Stock photo aesthetic (posed, fake smiles, generic)\n    - Graphs, charts, arrows pointing up\n    - Abstract metaphors that require explanation\n    - Cryptic symbolism (\"only Nostradamus understands\")\n    - Western corporate imagery in Bali context\n    - Tourist clichés (cocktails, infinity pool selfies)\n    - Depressing, dark, or dystopian mood\n    - Text or readable documents with specific info\n    \n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nNOW CREATE THE IMAGE PROMPT:\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nBased on your reasoning above, create a detailed image prompt for Gemini/Imagen.\nThe prompt should describe ONE specific scene that:\n1. Immediately communicates the article topic (2-second test)\n2. Captures the emotional core\n3. Is beautiful but CLEAR, not cryptic\n4. Shows a real moment, not an abstract concept\n\nWrite the prompt in English, be specific about composition, lighting, and mood.\n",
